        <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
        <p>MR. SPEAKER : Order, please. Before we start the daily routine today I would like to read a ruling. Yesterday I advised the House that I wanted to look more closely at some of the petitions that were presented, as I thought they didn't sound like they were in proper form.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#c4b08611-ea50-4069-9042-1634c77a855e">
        <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
        <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, on a point of privilege. I wonder if you could look into the matter of a ruling on the propriety of a letter written by the honourable Minister of Justice on June 14, 2012, which I believe violates the privileges of the members of this House. The letter as discussed in Question Period - and I will table another copy - was written to the Electoral Boundaries Commission and gives firm direction. The minister neither sought nor received any direction from this House of Assembly in advance of sending the letter.</p>
      </speech>

      <speech by="#4c929028-e1d5-46a9-9075-8620e1ec2e77">
        <from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from>
        <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, I know you will judge wisely and fairly. Quite simply put, the Minister of Justice acted well within the bounds of his office, within the direction that was given to the committee, and everything else, I would assert, put forward by the Progressive Conservative House Leader was just a bit of fluff to make it a little longer than what it should be. But I think when you look at it in its entirety, you will find out that the Minister of Justice acted well within the bounds of his office and nobody's privilege was violated.</p>

        <from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
        <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I would disagree, respectfully, with the Deputy Premier and agree with the member for Argyle. I think he has made a very strong case. I was a member of that select committee, with the member for Argyle, and your direction was very clear to the commission. I think that the most important part of this is not only for this boundary group going forward but, as well, as the member for Argyle has pointed out, it's for what happens with other similar independent committees. I think that your ruling is extremely important in this case and I know you will look into this very thoughtfully.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : So out goes the commission and the commission has its public meetings. During these public meetings the commission is inundated with presentations from the Acadian community - inundated - something that has never been seen. In Richmond we had almost 80 people come out. Argyle had 200 and Clare, they had a parade. They had a parade of people marching the streets to come meet with the Electoral Boundaries Commission - 500 people showed up at that meeting - 500 people. When you look at the recent voter turnout here in HRM in the municipal election - 37 per cent - 500 people in Clare came out to meet with the Electoral Boundaries Commission and what did that commission say? It said we looked at the terms of reference and the language clearly says that the commission is to be guided by the following principles, and that commission said based on that, we feel that we have the ability to look at what we've been told by Nova Scotians, to actually listen to Nova Scotians, something that Nova Scotians tell us every day - I don't feel the government is listening to me. I don't believe the province is hearing what I have to say and here we had a commission that said: we hear you. We hear what you're saying.</p>
