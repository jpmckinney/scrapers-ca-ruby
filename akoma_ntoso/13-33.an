          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, I rise today to move second reading of Bill No. 86, an Act to Ensure Public Safety through the Provision of Emergency Health Services. This province's paramedics do extremely vital and valuable work in our communities. All Nova Scotians appreciate and respect the work they do for their patients and depend on their skills in an emergency. Nova Scotians' lives will be put in jeopardy if ambulance services, including LifeFlight, were ever to be disrupted. We are taking every possible step to help the parties find a solution and reach an agreement.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I first want to begin by expressing my great appreciation to the men and women who are paramedics across this province, who do a vital and integral part of delivering health care to Nova Scotians, many times in some of the most difficult of situations. Whether it's the side of the road in a horrific accident or whether being called into one of our homes when we, as family members and loved ones are in panic mode in the environment, we ask them to come in and provide us with the kind of health care that we believe we deserve and want.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I want to go back a little bit and look as this process has been unfolding and the difficult challenges that we have had. I remember when the member for Kings West asked the Minister of Health and Wellness, in Question Period, what the contingency plan was, was it forced arbitration? The minister was unwilling to answer that question on the floor; he was unwilling to say what the plan was for this government. But it has become apparent over the last number of weeks that we were going to arrive at this point because this was the only plan that government had in place.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I rise today recognizing that this is a difficult day for many of the legislators who are assembled to do our job here today in the House of Assembly. Like all of us, I'm sure, I have many friends who I respect very much who are paramedics, and I'm sure almost everybody - if not everybody - here can say the same thing. I have spent a lot of time over the last few months discussing with paramedics on the ground their views about the work they do and the important role they play in our health care system, particularly in our emergency care system.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't plan to dwell on this long but I do want to say it's quite an accomplishment to speak for that long and not actually say where you stand on something; that's very unique. It is consistent with the remarks of the Liberal Leader in The ChronicleHerald this morning - I will table this - he wouldn't say whether the Liberals will support the bill or not, and further said, "The government doesn't need my help. This is not a minority government."</p>

If this bill were to be passed by 1:00 p.m., we would carry on and do the Committee on Law Amendments at 1:00 p.m. I'm asking for consent on that.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm proud our caucus was able to work to ensure that the Committee on Law Amendments is going to take place today at 1:00 p.m. I should advise anyone who wishes to make a presentation at the Committee on Law Amendments that they are to call the Legislative Counsel Office at 424-8941. Should they wish to make a presentation, they should certainly call beforehand in order to ensure that their name is added to the list. I can advise that we have a few more speakers on this bill, but we will see the Committee on Law Amendments sit at 1:00 p.m. in order to hear from Nova Scotians regarding Bill No. 86, and then have this bill returned to the House for debate once that process is completed.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to say that I am pleased to be here today, but I'm not - but I don't think anyone is. I know certainly our paramedics in this province are not happy to be at this point either. It has been a long road the last two and a half years whereby we would have hoped something could have been brought together by way of an agreement that would have been fair, a process that we are all used to in this province. It's common, we negotiate, we negotiate some more, it breaks off, we get to a conciliator at times, it breaks off and then here we are, unfortunately, at the arbitrated piece.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, today feels a bit like d&#xE8;j&#xFFFD; vu for me in standing as the member for Richmond in this House, because approximately 14 years ago the government of the day, on October 22, 1999, introduced Bill No. 9 which was an Act to Provide for the Continuation of Ground Ambulance Services in the Province. Here we are, 14 years later, and we have Bill No. 86, an Act to Ensure Public Safety through the Provision of Emergency Health Services.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Madam Speaker, there will be no peace in the world without goodwill and many would believe that these negotiations started a few weeks ago but would you believe it has been two and a half years since a contract was in place. I know many people out there in the province reading the papers would believe this only started a few weeks back. I recall my colleague from Hants West here in the Legislature asking a question this past Spring about this matter but there seemed to be no urgency at that time to solve it. Now we are in the eleventh hour facing a 76 per cent reduction in the paramedic service we depend on in our province.</p>
