Our government is committed to creating a competitive economic environment where entrepreneurs can succeed and businesses can grow. Our government will refocus its attention on small business. We need to give these business leaders the tools to grow and create jobs, and then get out of the way and allow them to prosper.</p>

          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to talk about an announcement the Premier and I made this morning regarding the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development's new Early Years branch. This announcement shows that our government is committed to ensuring Nova Scotia's youngest citizens have the supports they need to reach their highest potential, and we have come up with a plan to do so.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister's staff for providing a copy of her statement. I had an opportunity to attend the government's announcement earlier today regarding early learning. The announcement is very short on detail and the minister's responses in questions in estimates were incomplete.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, I first would like to thank the minister for a copy of his remarks in advance. I was thrilled and honoured to be able to attend the reception this morning, and I was also pleased to see that a New Glasgow-based family business was on this list, known as the Cornect Family Farm, who are bee farmers and produce quite a large amount of honey as they supply their product throughout the whole province.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, I'd first like to thank the minister for providing us with an advance copy of her statement today. It goes without saying that every member of this House would agree that giving the best possible start to our children is a priority. Today's announcement, although welcome, is lacking in details. Providing parents with the necessary resources to support their child as they grow is important, just as giving our kids every tool they need to succeed is. Unfortunately, we still don't know exactly what those resources will be, where the early centres will be, or what services will be offered to them.</p>

In fact, we have consulted with the Labour Management Review Committee on one of those particular changes, and we appreciate their input. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. One of the big problems with the Labour Management Review Committee, the powerful committee that the previous government set up to recommend changes to labour laws, is that it excluded non-unionized employers which, by the way, is about 70 per cent of the employers of our province - the vast majority. Perhaps that's why, when he was in Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party said that this is the biggest problem he has with the NDP's labour laws. In fact, he said in this House, one of the things I think is the biggest problem with this piece of legislation, quite frankly, is the Labour Management Review Committee.</p>

As the member can well appreciate, having been chief of staff to a new government, we've come into the House after about a month of being ministers. We have put forward three bills. They are important bills. They will not be the end of the labour legislation that this government will look at, but certainly we felt that these were our three priorities right now. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MS.

It would also be misleading, as the member has done, to suggest that the case in question was solely about first contract arbitration. In fact, the issues before the courts are about certification and not about arbitration.</p>

Nova Scotia's economy lost 2,600 full-time jobs over the past year from November 2012 to November 2013, according to the most recent reports - and I'll table that for the benefit of the House. In Opposition, the Liberal Party was very critical of the NDP record on jobs.

SAMSON : Well Mr. Speaker, again, when you look today at the 51 companies that were here in the legislature, I'm at a loss to understand why the Leader of the Official Opposition would not want to stand and recognize the important investment that the government has made in these companies. At the same time, the people of Nova Scotia clearly said that they want to see accountability, accountability in how monies were being invested by our department, by the government, which is why we've undertaken that much-needed review to ensure we have the proper economic development tools. And we're also waiting for the results of the Ray Ivany commission on the rural economy, which will certainly as well give us a sense of exactly where we should be focussing our efforts to grow the economy of Nova Scotia.</p>

They are not looking forward to more studies and more research and more consultations. They need a plan today. They saw a Party in Opposition that was so critical of the NDP for all the jobs that were lost under their administration. They correctly, or assumedly, thought a Party that was so critical of another would have some plans of its own and would be addressing their needs in this, their first session, of a new government. But there is nothing here that represents a jobs plan for those 2,600 Nova Scotian families, or the tens of thousands of others that are unemployed.</p>

MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to address this very issue just briefly with the media earlier and I'm sure that the Premier would be happy to address this further for the Leader of the NDP. The Premier has made it very clear in previous statements that we continue to see the Senate as an institution, an important body for the people of Nova Scotia. When we look at the growth in representation from Members of Parliament in Ontario and the western provinces that continues to dilute the influence of our members on the federal stage, the Senate gives us a guaranteed level of representation.</p>

There is no question that having a greater representation for Nova Scotia in the Senate is a benefit to us in terms of our influence in the country. Further to that, although there has obviously been a lot of trouble and scandal in the Senate, we have some very hard-working senators and I think it's worth noting.

At the present time we do have inconsistencies of wait times across Nova Scotia, and some of these are being addressed every year, but the timeliness of this program for young children is absolutely critical. We committed to doing a review of all of the recommendations for the autism strategy and, as part of reviewing those 51 recommendations, reviewing as well wait times for EIBI is part of that consideration.</p>

This family has two choices unfortunately - either send their son to school next year and become ineligible for the program, or to keep him home another year and wait for the services. This is an impossible choice for this family and one they should not be forced to make. The EIBI program was expanded so all eligible children will be offered the treatment.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I know in some of the districts across Nova Scotia there are training programs for parents that will assist them in supporting and helping the child until they actually get to meet a therapist. It's obvious in this district perhaps that wait-list and perhaps even for parental instruction is still very limited, but again this program is one that is very, very important to both the minister and this Party, who have advocated long and hard and moved autism from zero dollars to $4 million to $8 million. And doing what we can to support parents and children is, in fact, critical to that child's future.</p>

There are serious differences in wait times for the EIBI program between district health authorities. This program is to be based on the age of the child, but if the family in my constituency were to move to a different health authority, mere miles away, they may not have this problem.</p>

An issue long overlooked by the former government was the service gap for children between 16 and 18 years of age, under the Children and Family Services Act. The Auditor General concluded the Act was out of date.

The time will be now, within the next four years, when that Act will be opened. That part of the Act will be reviewed, as well as other areas, such as the definition of neglect.

Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General commented on his department's response to his recommendation and said it's clear that the department does not intend to initiate a revision of the legislation.

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. I'm happy to hear that the department staff is reaching out to Maritime Steel, because it has been over a year now that the workers have been strung along in many ways for political reasons. The NDP Government effectively slammed the door on Maritime Steel by requesting information and then requesting more information, and then, only after a year of doing this, deciding to ask for a business plan, only to use it to request more information.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, again, we're certainly open to hearing suggestions on how to move Maritime Steel forward. But at the end of the day we need to ensure that if we are going to be asked to make investments, we are protecting taxpayers - something which I know the Leader of the honourable member's Party has been very vocal about. Therefore, the department has already clearly communicated to the proprietor what information they would require before being able to properly assess any requests for public funds to assist with that business. I can tell you that we would certainly be more than happy to receive that information and to be able to work and see what ways we could possibly see the reopening of that company and jobs in rural Nova Scotia.</p>

          <from>MR. HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I again thank the minister for his answer. The workers are suffering tremendous hardship. The workers that Maritime Steel would employ are skilled labour and they are good jobs, filled by the type of residents that Nova Scotia needs. The NDP Government seemed quite content to keep asking for information and then sitting back and waiting, and that may have been fine for them at that time, but it is not a reasonable expectation for the workers to just continue to wait. The workers are facing real deadlines and they can't just wait. The workers face bill payments and other types of deadlines, so I would ask the minister if he would be willing to commit to book a couple of hours in his busy schedule and sit down in a timely fashion and meet with the workers and the owner of Maritime Steel, possibly within the month?</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more unfortunate than when workers are left in a situation where they don't know who to believe anymore. I think Maritime Steel is an unfortunate example of that. The member referenced the political realities of Pictou County at the time and as such, unfortunately, it is the workers who have been left to wait.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, on November 6th, the Department of Environment issued a directive to Northern Pulp to allow the department to closely monitor the company's progress on meeting the emission limits outlined in its operating approval, because the company was exceeding the operating permit levels 15 per cent of the time. This directive specifically requires monthly reporting on total reduced-sulphur emissions and detailed descriptions of the work being done on the equipment to further reduce emissions.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, sexual assault service providers and advocates across this province have called upon this government to implement the sexual assault strategy to address the issue of sexualized violence. The Minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women Act assured us in 2011 that the government was aggressively working on a strategy. Yesterday when questioned in the House on the sexual assault, the Minister of Justice insulted every Nova Scotian with his response to the question. So my question to the Premier is, where is the sexual assault strategy?</p>

          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, the government is working with those who are advocates in this area and with organizations right around the province and, in fact, are implementing a program which is designed to meet the needs of Nova Scotians with respect to this very important issue. The Leader of the Opposition would know that there are already in place, in some parts of the province, specialized medical personnel who are designed to deal particularly with those who are victims of sexual assault. He would probably already know that in the cases of those that are reported and go on to court, there are services in place which are designed to support those victims and to provide them with the services that they need in order to be able to deal with these very important issues.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, we know that Nova Scotia has the highest rate of sexual assaults in Canada, 40 assaults for every 1,000 people. Given the staggering rate of sexual assaults in Nova Scotia and considering they were aggressively working on it in 2011, my question is, why is there no urgency from this government to act to implement a strategy to resource outreach initiatives, to support victims and bring aggressors to justice?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the fact is we do all of those things already. We are, in fact, very aggressively dealing with these issues, trying to provide across-the-spectrum support. It is, of course, not enough just to engage in the post-event remedial issues, it is also important that we are addressing the causes associated with it and that is, in fact, what the government is seeking to do. It is a societal problem, which we certainly acknowledge. I know that even on the reporting side, I think the reports are pretty clear, even on the ones that come to our attention: there is literally many-fold more that don't get reported and, therefore, we are unable to provide the kind of help that we would wish to be able to provide.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly four years. Victims, support workers and all Nova Scotians want action. My question to the Premier is, when will Nova Scotians see a complete sexual assault strategy for Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as with any strategy or with any action plan, often we do not wait until the strategy is complete or the action plan is complete. We try to put these things in place in advance, where they make sense. We have done some of that already with respect to specialized medical personnel; in fact, right across the province, those who are health care providers have already received training to deal with people who are victims of sexual assault and we're going to continue to do that and not wait until there is an overall strategic framework to do that. I would say that work is continuing. The Leader of the Opposition would know that this is a well-organized community. They have been engaged with the government for some time on it. They have had support from the government to do some of the work they are doing in relation to this issue.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, I'm really baffled by the commentary just provided by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He seems to have missed the fact that over the last four years there has been more done to reorient income into the hands of low-income Nova Scotians than at any time in our past. Not only did we take the HST off home electricity but we also took it off children's clothing. We also took it off other necessities in the home.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the whole problem is that this is a government that gives a little bit with one hand and takes a whole lot more with the other. That's why it's so tough on lower-income Nova Scotians today. But since we're talking about one hand and the other, it's also a government where the left hand and the right hand don't know what the other is doing. Today's announcement talks about three Early Years Centres to be set up somewhere in the province, but at the same time, 30 of our smaller community schools continue to be under review with no plan in sight for how that's going to change.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I suppose the answer to that question could go just about any way, but I'll start with this: first of all, there is more money in the pockets of low-income Nova Scotians as a result of the initiatives undertaken by this government. That's the first thing.</p>

This minister has had ample opportunity - one full year - to respond to those recommendations and to those in particular. One recommendation, which was supported by the Liberal amendments to their Bill No. 30, that of course was defeated by the NDP; and again the amendments to Bill No. 102, again defeated by the NDP and included in the Bill No. 106, the Liberal bill, asked, "The Governor in Council shall direct the Minister of Education, the Minister of Justice and any other members . . . to enter into negotiations with the Government of Canada with the purpose of making changes to the Criminal Code (Canada) with regard to addressing inappropriate behaviour and bullying by electronic means, including Internet and cellular telephone use." I will table that.</p>

The reality is that there is a constant, ongoing exchange between the departments here and the federal government about the kinds of changes that we see as necessary, whether it is with the Criminal Code or with other pieces of legislation.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, one of the more important recommendations of the cyberbullying task force, Dr. Wayne MacKay's report, was that cyberbullying, a new and devastating phenomenon in our province and around the world, ought to be defined in law, including provincially, where the consequences, including restitution, can be spelled out for those who engage in cyberbullying.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out already, we have a constant ongoing dialogue with the federal government around issues like cyberbullying.

However, they have now had to downgrade their revenue growth projections to 3.8 per cent. In short, the federal government has had to adjust its tax base estimates downward, and with that the feds are expecting lower revenue growth. This realistic adjustment is in stark contrast to what the Finance Minister is telling Nova Scotians today about our revenue projections.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, private-sector economists at all of the major financial institutions review Nova Scotia's budget economic assumptions, and they compare them against their own forecasts. In addition to that, the Conference Board of Canada, APEC economists, and economists here in the universities all look at the economic assumptions of the department, and having done that, they concur with the assumptions of the department, and that formulates the estimates, the fiscal forecast, of our budget - a balanced budget - a balanced budget that restores really important services like the children's dental program that were cut by the Liberals in the 1990s.</p>

Where's forecasting in the budget for a 0.2 per cent decline in employment next year? Just as important to note, the labour income growth last year was slower than it was even during the recession, and because of downgraded GDP growth, the federal government is expecting revenues to be a full $17 billion lower than were predicted in the Fall. All of these are facts. We, too, are facing a slowing economy and nominal GDP is only expected to grow 2.3 per cent in 2013 and 3 per cent in 2014. With all of these facts affecting the tax base, it is very difficult for us to understand how the Finance Minister can provide a lot of bafflegab about how she's going to achieve this overly-estimated revenue future.</p>

          <p>MR. TREVOR ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, on February 24, 2010, an announcement of the Target 100 program was made by the Premier and the Minister of Community Services. At the time of the announcement the Premier commented that this program was designed to connect real people with real jobs in their community, and not just any jobs, but good jobs with benefits, profit-sharing, and opportunities.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Thank you for the question. The Target 100 program is a very important program. I believe that we're well up in the high - around 48, 50 in the numbers. It is a program that is different than others because it is being run by the co-operative, plus the other factor is that it's a higher level of employment for individuals coming off income assistance. It often puts them like in an assistant management position. It has been a program that has been working well for those who are involved. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned the first time, the fact is that the program is actually being run by the co-operative and we support the co-operative through the clientele that we feel have the ability and the education or initiative that they want to go forward with this. So if there's an agreement with the clientele that they want to be involved in this program, we support them from that angle. Then the co-operative supports them in finding the work and ensuring that they have the monitoring and support to make it successful for them. Thank you.</p>

PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, in fact this government and this minister and the Department of Community Services and our hard-working staff are doing many things that have never been done in the province before. Not only are we working with Target 100 but we're looking at the whole ESIA, which is the employment income program, which hasn't been looked at. We're looking at it in a variety of different areas, including the employability of individuals, and we're working with LAE also, so we are doing things very differently. We're doing them in a holistic manner, bringing departments together and providing opportunities that neither Party ever thought of looking at when they were in government.</p>

Back in the 1990s, Nova Scotians will remember and health care workers will remember, and they can pretend it didn't happen but it happened. We're going to continue to invest in Nova Scotia. We have the first physician resource plan in the province's history. The Liberals didn't bring one in; the Progressive Conservatives never brought one in. We need to ensure that we have the right mix of physicians in this province so that we can improve services for all Nova Scotians. We're going to continue to work to ensure that Nova Scotians have access to the right doctors that they need and we're going to continue to work with all district health authorities to ensure that people have access to the surgeries they need.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is hearing the alarm bells going that the physician resource plan doesn't quite monitor the true clinical footprint of this province. This is a surgeon who wanted to stay. The district asked the department for the financial resources to keep her and the answer from the NDP Government was no - so much for autonomous local decision by DHAs. We have an NDP Government that can find over $1 million for self-promoting TV ads, yet no money to keep an orthopedic surgeon here in the province. Can the minister tell us why self-promotion is more important to this government than keeping an orthopaedic surgeon to deal with our wait times?</p>

In fact, on April 5, 2011, the minister stated there would be no changes whatsoever. This should not impact their bottom line. Then again on April 6, 2012, the minister said that the municipalities are actually better off under these arrangements.

That means the municipality will be forced into the position of raising extra revenue or cutting services. They have been forced into this decision, because of the MOU - the province is going to assume more of these services that fall under provincial jurisdiction, which they refuse to do.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, from February 2009 to February 2013 the price of energy went up 44.5 per cent. If we compare the four years before that to the price of energy, it only went up 6.5 per cent; then of course the previous government didn't use dirty, imported coal to produce energy. During the four-year comparison, there is a 37.9 per cent difference in percentage increases; that is horrendous. The NDP has inflated the price of energy to the most expensive in the country and the price of their solution is well unknown. Yet small- to medium-size businesses, and everyday Nova Scotians, are left wondering why there are no jobs. Mr. Speaker, the province is not open for business. My question to the Minister of ERDT is will he admit not only have the NDP jobs failed but they have created a perfect storm of economic breakdown?</p>

The fact that we've got PROJEX, the west coming east, IBM building a centre of excellence that could have been anywhere in the world, and they chose Nova Scotia.

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, if we look at the CPI in general for the last four years and the four years preceding that, the percentage increases are 11.7 and 6.9 per cent respectively. That means that all items with in the CPI have increased by 4.7 per cent more than the four years before the NDP started their reign of terror. This means there is less disposable income for consumers and more expensive conditions for business operators. Shelter increased by an additional 1 per cent from the four years before, clothing 7.7 per cent, goods 9.5 per cent, and transportation 20.6 per cent. These numbers are significant. Now if the NDP had their way, I'm sure they would be hidden along with their $27 million error. My question is, will the minister apologize for making life harder for Nova Scotians and adopt policies that actually grow the economy and create jobs.</p>

Just very recently, after the good Minister of Finance tabled her budget here in the House, she went to Cape Breton and she addressed the chamber of commerce. As a result of that the chamber was quoted in the Cape Breton Post - bear with me because I'm going to table this - and guess what the chamber of commerce said? This is by Paula Gallagher who is chairwoman of the chamber of commerce, and I quote - this is from Cape Breton Post and it is dated March 28, 2013, "MacDonald said one of the major initiatives in the April 4 budget will be a plan to simplify access to programs for small businesses. She also said the small business tax would be cut half a percentage point to three per cent - the lowest rate in 20 years." And I quote, "The budget reflects the fact that the minister and the government have listened to what matters to the business community." Paula Gallagher, Mr. Speaker.</p>

I know we recently met in my office where the member brought this to my attention, the concerns of his community. My commitment to him was, as soon as possible, to get down to see the Villa Acadienne in his area, in his riding, because I've tried to do that on a number of occasions across the province.</p>

          <p>MR. GAUDET : Mr. Speaker, in 2011 the department staff started a review of existing long-term care facilities in order to develop a priority list for the department. So, again, to the Minister of Health and Wellness, could the minister please tell us whether the review is completed and, if so, will the minister table the replacement priority list before the end of business today?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : We know the demographic shift and change that we're seeing here in Nova Scotia. That's why, as a government, we need to ensure we change policies. We ensure that services are there for seniors, and long-term care is one of those areas we need to continue to look at investing in, but also ensuring that seniors in our province have options, so they have options if they need to go into a long-term care facility - but more importantly, and from what I've been hearing, and I know many members of my caucus have been hearing from Nova Scotians, especially seniors, is that they want to stay in their homes longer. So we're going to continue to move forward on both fronts, ensuring that long-term care facilities are there in communities across the province, but ensuring that the services like home care are there for seniors also, so that they have good options for the care, the residence, and the support they need as they get older here in our province.</p>

He sees the impact on the families travelling out West and the impact that that has on the family unit. He knows that the CBRM cannot afford the $90 million required for waste water upgrades in the next few years and he feels societal impacts that occur when families leave and never return to Cape Breton, as do you.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the mayors, wardens and chief administrative officers of the Strait area have raised concerns over the decision by the NDP to move from 12 regional development authorities to six regional enterprise networks, to carry out economic development initiatives in Nova Scotia. The Strait area, which includes municipal units within the Counties of Richmond, Inverness, Guysborough and Antigonish, have a long history of working together on many fronts. They are concerned that having the Strait area divided between two regional enterprise networks will weaken the focus on economic development in the Strait. My question to the minister is, will the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism advise whether his government is open to the proposal for a Strait Area Regional Enterprise Network?</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I think one thing that all Nova Scotians want is strong, economically viable communities. One of the things that should be known, when it comes to the regional enterprise networks, is that this is led by the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities. We are one of the stakeholders and the downsizing of the RDAs was one of the recommendations that was put forth a few years ago by Donald Savoie. The municipalities thought that this was an appropriate avenue to take and certainly as far as we, the government, are concerned, we are open to listen to anything. The door hasn't been closed on anything yet.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to hear that response. Projects such as the Melford container terminal, the proposed Bear Head liquefied natural gas site, and possible expansion of NuStar Terminal in Point Tupper, present exciting possibilities for the economy of the Strait area, yet having the Strait divided between two regional enterprise networks - one for all of Cape Breton Island and one for Guysborough, Antigonish and Pictou Counties - will certainly weaken the focus of these projects and others for the Strait area. My question for the minister is, is the minister prepared to meet with the mayors, wardens and chief administrative officers of the municipal units in the Strait area to explore the possibility of a stand-alone Strait Area Regional Enterprise Network?</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. In 2005 the former NDP Minister of Finance and member for Halifax Fairview understood bracket creep. If I may quote, it was said at the time, "There is no increase in the income tax rates but, let's make no mistake about it, this budget includes an increase in income tax, but it does it indirectly not directly. There are two principal ways the government is doing that, and one is that there is no inflation indexing of the tax brackets. So while inflation marches along, the tax brackets do not. Simply by virtue of inflation, more people move into a higher tax bracket." My question for the current Minister of Finance, does the current minister - if the NDP cared about bracket creep in 2005, why are they 0 for 4 in addressing the matter in their last four budgets?</p>

I've been in this House for 15 years, and one of the things that I do remember was when Premier Hamm and the government of the day decoupled the federal and provincial income tax systems. That led to provincial income tax no longer being indexed, so there's nothing new here. I don't know how many Finance Ministers we've had since that time, but I venture there have been three or four, anyway.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : It's a pleasure for me to get up and speak a little bit about this bill. Madam Speaker, when I looked at what this bill is about, it strikes me as highly unrealistic. It's a suggestion that every five years the government will report on financial and fiscal and different government policies that have come into play, and it will report on how that's going to affect people 45 years in the future.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : We're talking here about whether or not people live by the philosophy that they espouse in bills like Bill No. 6, which is before us, this concern about the future, about good fiscal policy, about making decisions that are good for the future and I'm saying that there are things that we need to know about how people manage their affairs that have to do with emulating - and I'm talking about the Third Party and the Leader of the Third Party and how his stance today emulates that of Prime Minister Harper, when he was in Opposition, promising there would be only balanced budgets in the future and then in fact delivering us budget after budget that's been in deficit, year after year in deficit, growing debt every single year. That was an extremely right-wing, Conservative person, a right-wing Conservative Government, and yet, at the end of the day, we've seen year after year of huge deficits. That's what we can expect from the Third Party and they are speaking out of both sides of their mouth when they bring in this kind of a bill to ask us to consider something that is not even workable.</p>

Every day I think about how our decisions in this House have an impact on the future of our children and our grandchildren. I think that all governments and all Parties need to be accountable to the young people who are coming forward.

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Madam Speaker, I'm happy to stand and discuss this Progressive Conservative bill that has come forward. The Liberal caucus will be unequivocally opposing this bill. We see it as an attack on the collective bargaining process, and we don't think that is what this province needs right now. This will be a position that we do share with the government, that collective bargaining is a fundamental process by which employers and employees are able to reach contracts together. There's a balance of power within that relationship that the collective bargaining process keeps and ensures that the outcome is fair, and hopefully fair to both parties.</p>
