          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I rise in my place this afternoon to speak to the important topic of making life better for Nova Scotia seniors. People tell me every day about how seniors contribute in meaningful ways to the life and vibrancy of their communities. It's our job to ensure they are encouraged and supported in their efforts to remain independent. After all, making life better for seniors also makes life better for their families and their communities.</p>

          <from>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT</from>
          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for the advance copy of her remarks. Essentially what we've heard here today is a recap of what this government thinks they have done for seniors. I can tell you that many seniors in my community are still hurting and will be hurting unless more changes. While government boasts about the changes in the amount of income a person living in a community can keep when their spouse is in a nursing home, this is a good thing, especially in light of the fact that the maximum standard accommodation rate has increased by $4,500 since the NDP took power. The maximum standard accommodation rate as of October 31, 2011, was $36,100. It could be more now but we just haven't heard anything from the Minister of Health and Wellness about this.</p>

          <from>MR. KEITH BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, first of all I'd like to thank the minister for providing our caucus with a copy of her statement in advance. I'd like to point out a few facts that the minister didn't tell us about the way the NDP treats seniors in Nova Scotia. The wait list for long-term care beds has grown to 2,250 people; that's almost a 50 per cent increase since the NDP took office. The waiting list for nursing homes is longer than it has ever been. The NDP haven't announced a single new bed since they became government over three years ago; all they've done is cut ribbons on facilities that were announced before they took office.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, that same NDP campaign document said the NDP "Would create the secure jobs Nova Scotia's economy needs." Nova Scotia has lost 3,500 full-time jobs since the NDP have taken office, but it has gained about 13,000 part-time jobs since they've taken office. My question to the minister, why does the government think a part-time job is good for the economy of Nova Scotia?</p>

Statistics Canada from June 2009 through to October 2012 shows there have been 7,600 additional jobs created in Nova Scotia.

I understand that it is very difficult for them to try to understand. What they should know about the support for the Irving contract is two things. First of all, had we not supported the contract, that contract would have gone to Quebec, it would have gone to British Columbia, and all of that opportunity, the 10,000 or 11,000 jobs identified by the Conference Board of Canada, would have gone somewhere else.</p>

That is some 11,000 jobs, more than $2 billion in tax revenue to the province. You could go to any bank and you say to them, I'm going borrow a certain amount of money and then I'm going to pay you more than 30 times over, more than 100 times over - I think any bank would take that deal.</p>

          <from>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, in November 2011, I joined the Premier and the member for Cape Breton West on a trip to Ottawa to try to clean up the MV Miner mess. This is a very dangerous situation, we have a derelict bulk carrier rotting off the coast of Cape Breton. To make things worse, the Miner is located on a protected wilderness area known as Scaterie Island. My question to the Premier is, why is the MV Miner still floating in the rough, Atlantic waters and when will we be finally rid of this boat?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course, as you know this happened as a result of an accident at sea - I assume it was an accident, nobody would deliberately allow a former bulk carrier to float ashore. The trouble is, and I've pointed this out time and time again, is that the federal government does not have in place appropriate rules with respect to the towing of salvage in Canadian waters. There was no insurance on the vessel to ensure there was a cleanup. There were not, in my view, inspection rules that were appropriate, or if they were appropriate they weren't appropriately followed. As the member opposite said, we have raised this directly with the minister. We have raised it with various members of the federal Cabinet, yet all of the pleas we make with respect to the federal government to clean up a mess that they allowed to happen have gone unanswered.</p>

The Premier is talking about federal jurisdiction and he's talking about Bennington Group having shirked their responsibilities, but the reality is that this is an absolute mess.

          <p>MR.

That's all the information needed to take someone's identity. This can make identity theft easier and this government did not consult the privacy officer on this.

We know DSTN's wind turbine business is struggling and we know they are rushing to diversify. Daewoo doesn't seem like a company to rush and change plans on the fly. Nova Scotians and the people of Pictou County are concerned about this investment and about this project. My question for the Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Minister, or whoever he punts it to - is there any part of the contract with Daewoo that commits them to staying in the Province of Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased with the relationship that this government has with DSTN. We've signed an agreement with DSTN, the parent company of Daewoo, world-renowned, known around the globe as one of the top shipbuilders in the world. They've diversified in other areas. We are proud as Nova Scotians to have this company as a partner for the good people in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, DSTN has said "We [DSME Trenton] have one of the highest costs of manufacturing in the world." They have the highest overall tax burden, the highest corporate tax rate, and highest power rates of any province in Canada. Those factors weigh on any business, especially a struggling business. My question to the minister is, in this minister's daily briefings with DSTN, what concerns around the cost of doing business have they raised and how many Nova Scotians are employed at DSTN today?</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, some kind of public forum is needed to heal the deep wounds and divisions and get to the bottom of questions surrounding the past of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. In his scrum, the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism indicated that he had been, at one time, a member of the Board of Directors for the NSHCC. That raises important questions of why he is involved with discussions about the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children, whether there should be a public inquiry and potentially Cabinet discussions about lawsuits.</p>

Of course, we know the serious allegations of terrible events taking place at the home extend into the early 1980s. It's very important for Nova Scotians to know that the minister was not there during that time. He would not be able to be part of those discussions if this were true, nor would he be speaking as a Cabinet Minister, which appeared to happen in the scrum yesterday, or last week, especially not only because the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism cannot say when he was on the board.</p>

Of course the people involved, whether they are the claimants or whether they are the defendants, have the right to have that process go through the due process of law. That means to have them make the allegations, to substantiate them, to before what is a system that has been put in place literally since Runnymede, where both the claimant and a defendant can stand before an arbitrator, an impartial, independent arbitrator and have their claims heard.

          <p>MR. TREVOR ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, last week I was encouraged by the Minister of Community Services' announcement surrounding the discussion paper on the Nova Scotia housing strategy. Reading through the document, it would seem that the government and this minister understand the fundamental needs of Nova Scotians when it comes to their housing needs. In a quote from the press release, the minister says, "We know that when people can choose the housing that's right for them, they are healthier, better educated, more self-reliant and our communities are more vibrant."</p>

People's power bills are going up every month. Food costs go up every month. These folks cannot wait three or four months for a cheque to come in the mail when they have to pay their bills monthly.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, this particular government has done more than any government, over decades and decades, in terms of helping people break the cycle of poverty. It's difficult, it's challenging, but we are the ones who have taken up this challenge because we care about the people of Nova Scotia. We care about those individuals who are struggling - not like the former Progressive Conservative Government. Their answer to breaking the cycle of poverty was increasing the income assistance by maybe $3 to $4 a month. The Liberals' answer to breaking the cycle of poverty was cutting back on dental programs for children - the ages of the children that could receive those programs - and to roll back on salaries. That was their poverty reduction strategy - it is this government and this minister who has committed to breaking that cycle of poverty.</p>

(Applause) The last shelter allowance increase was in 2006 by the then-Progressive Conservative Government. Last week, in an article in The ChronicleHerald, it was cited that young professionals are even having difficulty finding affordable housing here in HRM.

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. No question, breast screening here in Nova Scotia is an important issue. It's something that was recognized a number of years ago, that we needed to change the way we provided those screenings to women here in Nova Scotia. That's why I'm glad to say with the new release of the schedule for the mobile unit that every woman in Nova Scotia will have access to the more advanced digital mammography - the first time in our history that we can have that.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question was about the women in northern Nova Scotia who had no access at all to that particular service for 12 full months. I would like to table a letter - and the minister has a copy of this - from Joan Millican, co-chair of Along the Shore Community Health Board. This is a board that represents an entire rural area of the Colchester East Hants District Health Authority.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : That's not the case at all, Mr. Speaker. The Nova Scotia Breast Screening Program has really moved in a positive manner to ensure that Nova Scotians can gain access to digital mammography screening here in the province. We recognize - and it was part of the plan, and part of the plan of the committee that was together in 2005, to ensure that these fixed sites obtained the more advanced digital mammography screening units.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, there are two issues. One is that the people in northern Nova Scotia had no access to that mobile unit for one full year. The second issue is the minister did not even inform those residents through the community health board that they would not have that access. So there are two issues here. Certainly an advanced technology is important, but there are many people in rural Nova Scotia who cannot get themselves to a site and they do rely on the mobile unit.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, it's important to recognize where we were and where we are when it comes to breast screening here in the province. The member opposite should know; she should have been briefed when she was the Health Minister. This has been a process to get to today, where all women in Nova Scotia will have access to the more advanced digital mammography screening in Nova Scotia. We should be very proud of that. Nova Scotia is leading the way across the country when it comes to digital mammography, not only in the fixed sites but in the mobile sites also.</p>

There is no walk-in service in Dartmouth, Amherst or Sydney, and all MEP offices will be closed to the public as of January 1, 2013 - Happy New Year from the NDP. Mr. Speaker, 9,000 families are owed over $80 million in maintenance payments. How does closing regional offices, where cheques can be accepted directly and where both payers and payees could receive assistance filling out forms, et cetera, improve the lives of these 9,000 families awaiting payments?</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Well, the first thing that I would like to point out is, if my memory serves me well, the Party across, the Opposition Party, had complained about the inefficiencies, the poor quality of service, and that came out in various reports. So we have taken steps now to improve the system and make sure that it is more streamlined, that there are accesses being improved. Having a regional office in some communities and not in others was not a fair balance of the system but bringing people together, training them, retooling, and making the system more modern is. However, I do see a difference between the Liberal Party; they are still stuck back 20 years ago.</p>

          <from>MS. REGAN</from>
          <p>MS. REGAN : Speaking of being stuck in the past, the government Web site still includes information that indicates regional offices are open for business. Nova Scotians are being asked on that site to be patient with maintenance enforcement changes; in fact, the site lists changes that people should "watch out for" - that's watch out for, not watch for. So 9,000 families, as they wait for their $80 million in arrears payments, are left to wonder if the bank will be patient, if the landlord will be patient, if the power company will be patient. My question to the minister is, if this consolidation of services will improve service to Nova Scotians, why are you asking Nova Scotians to be patient and to watch out?</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : I'll simply say in regard to that, that any transition or re-modernizing and improving the quality of the system takes a bit of a transitional change and we are in that transitional change. There are going to be some hiccups in the process and we are working through to correct them. It is not a perfect world but we are working to strive to make those changes and we are very optimistic as we are moving forward that we will have a very sound, improved system to answer the very issue that she raised about getting dollars back into those hands of the people who need them. It's about putting families first but if we continue doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different outcome, that's the Liberal way. We believe in being progressive.</p>

While we don't have a contract per se with them, we've been trying to facilitate, to work with them to get through the laws and the regulations within the province.

Not one word - obviously because they agree with what we're doing on this side of the House. Not one word.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member from the NDP who just spoke - and I stress NDP Party. I can recall when the Premier of the province, the Premier who's there today, was on this side of the House and promised everything under the sun to everybody who walked forward. It didn't matter who they were, he promised it to them. Said they shouldn't spend money on this and that and complained about everything that existed, and guess what? He gets elected and he does exactly all the things that he spoke against when he was Leader of the Opposition.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I know the NDP don't want to hear about this, but these are the facts that are going on today, and the regular person on the street understands this. This is a better deal for today's families all right - better deals to get them unemployed; it costs more for everyday living, in everything they do. You know, we've seen the power rates go up 30 per cent; we've seen the GST or HST, whatever you want to call it, increase 25 per cent; we've seen bracket creep on income tax that was an immoral tax that the Premier, when he was Leader of the Opposition, was talking about, bracket creep is still there; and we see fee increases on every single thing in this province - fee increases. And they talk about the great job they're doing to keep youth in the area - well we do a great job educating young people in Nova Scotia and we might as well give them a plane ticket to go to Alberta because that's where they all go anyway, and it's very unfortunate that happens.</p>

Nova Scotia youth between the ages of 15 and 24 have the highest unemployment rate in Canada, at just over 20 per cent. Also, it's almost twice as hard to find a job in Nova Scotia as it is for other Canadians. There are 10 people unemployed for every vacancy in Nova Scotia, whereas the national average is 5.3.</p>

It has three parts; it's a restaurant, a distillery, and a brewery. It's nice that it's located in Guysborough County. I've never had the chance to visit that business but I'd like to, but I do know that I was criticized for criticizing the government. What I had more or less said was it's not right for the government to be picking winners and losers. There are other businesses, other restaurants and breweries and distilleries in the province and as soon as the government starts giving out these forgivable loans, they are picking winners and losers and that's a mistake.</p>

I know she has an awful dilemma on her hands with the failed and botched deal that the Premier and the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism put together to save the Bowater Mersey paper mill in her riding. It's unfortunate that that didn't work, but from the beginning it appeared that it wouldn't work, and unfortunately, it seems to be a desperate attempt by the member for Queens and the NDP Government to divert attention from their failed economic record to bring something like this forward.
