          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : My question is for the Premier. Madam Speaker, the Premier has signed a deal with Bowater worth up to $90 million and Nova Scotians are still left with some unanswered questions. As I'm sure you're well aware, more people in the Bowater area were laid off as of late last week, yet there are no guarantees in this deal which will keep the remaining employees at the mill employed, not at the end of the five years or during the life of the agreement at any point. What guarantees did the Premier get from Resolute that there would be no further layoffs coming for the people of Bowater when he signed this deal?</p>

          <from>HON. DARRELL DEXTER</from>
          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Madam Speaker, I just point out that part of the agreement was that in addition to the very difficult decisions that were made by the workers in the plant themselves, there was an understanding that they would not be disproportionately affected by having more of their workers laid off than were taken up in management. In the cuts that you saw last week it was on the management side of the mill's administration. The commitment from the mill is to operate the two paper machines over the course of that time. The manner in which that operation takes place, who will be in the plant, what those numbers look like, are part of the collective agreement that is signed with the union.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, when Nova Scotians look at this deal they will find nowhere are there guarantees that employees will be kept on. Employees have no job security - not today, not next week, not next year. Furthermore there is nothing in this agreement to stop Resolute from packing up and leaving at any time. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier point out where in this agreement that there are guarantees of job security for the remaining employees at Bowater?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, what I would point out to the Leader of the Official Opposition is that there is a great deal more job security today for those people of that mill than if the mill were closed.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, that is cold comfort to those employees who have had to make the very tough decision to vote against laying off some of their neighbours. All we're asking is a simple question, what assurance did the Premier get from Resolute that the remaining employees at Bowater would not be faced with the same decision and be forced to be laid off, what job security do they have under your agreement?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I'm sure this is just obstinance and I'm sure it's late in the session so they don't really want to hear the answer, but the negotiation of the job levels are done with the union through their collective agreement. The jobs that are in place through the union contract are the ones that will allow them to safely operate the two paper machines at the facility.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Last week the Minister of Finance kicked off a $610 million spending spree, a spree that will be paid for largely with borrowed money. This is a bit of a surprise given that just before the last election the then Leader of the NDP, the now Premier said, "That dramatically affects the ability of future governments to be able to provide services . . . it will affect everything from health care to the ability to reduce taxes."</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, the simple fact of the matter is, unless the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is suggesting that we shouldn't be replacing bridges, or that we shouldn't be paving roads, or that we shouldn't build infrastructure, it is necessary to have a capital plan each and every year. This is a good plan; it is set out for everyone to see, which I know is a novelty for the Progressive Conservatives.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, what's a novelty for Nova Scotians is a Leader that says one thing before the election and keeps to the same tune after the election, that's what a novelty is and that is the point here today. The fact of the matter is the capital plans in this province over the last decade have averaged around $300 million, but he's just launched an amount twice that as a spending spree this year. This is the same Premier that said before the election in that same article, "This is not a race to see who can spend the most money." My question to the Premier is, will he stop the race to spend the most money and assure Nova Scotians that he is serious about reducing debt and not adding to it every year?</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Yes, well, Madam Speaker, that is an old trick and the Premier knows it. No one knows an old trick better than our Premier, apparently. Here's another novelty. In the NDP's election platform they made a commitment to Nova Scotians, and that is that the NDP is committed to ensuring that Nova Scotians live within their means - certainly a novelty now if we've ever seen one. This is another example of an NDP broken promise. This one just happens to be a very expensive one, paid for with more debt.</p>

          <from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from>
          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Madam Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. Nova Scotia's education partners - representing the province's teachers, parents, Acadian parents, school administrators, and elected board officials - spoke out today to warn that further funding cuts to education will negatively impact students in the classroom. These are the same partners who spoke out in the Fall of 2010 with their concerns about the impact of budget cuts to public education. The government at that time ignored those and continued on with their cuts. In fact, on April 11th, the Minister of Education stood in the House and said that she trusted the impact would not be felt in the classroom.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Madam Speaker, this morning the Nova Scotia Federation of Home and School Associations gave an example of how this government's gouging of public education has affected them in the classroom. Before last year's funding cuts, home and school associations would raise money for extracurricular events, for playground equipment and other additional services for their children. This, by the way, is the accumulated surplus fund that the minister at one point suggested school boards could use, failing to recognize it is fundraising money. It's not accessible to the school boards to use.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Madam Speaker, women's organizations in this province are under-resourced and underfunded. While service providers should be focusing their energies on serving their clientele, they have to spend a lot of their time and energy worrying about levels of funding from year to year. On top of this, the cost of service delivery is climbing with the high price of power, fuel and increased taxes. Women's service providers, the very service providers who are forced to stretch every dollar to the maximum to meet their clients' needs, those service providers are asking us exactly how much money was spent on a recent domestic violence poll?</p>

I wanted to point out to the minister in this question that a similar department in the Department of Health and Wellness, a similar area - the long-term care support - those income levels are adjusted annually. Every November, we hear of new levels and adjustments to the income and fee levels. So I would like to ask the minister if she will make this an annual review once she has the figures in hand so that we don't get behind in terms of inflation and people who would otherwise be able to remain independent, don't fall out of the service.

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, home care and long-term care are part of continuing care; they're part of the very important programs that we offer to seniors in Nova Scotia. The review that occurs with respect to long-term care is an annual review. The review that is going on around fees associated with home care is part of our pre-budget preparation and we will continue to review these matters and look at them in the totality of the government's priorities with respect to providing high-quality health care services to seniors in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Madam Speaker, yesterday we learned the details around the cost of the NDP's new paving plan tender. The NDP are paying $3.6 million to an American company for the purchase of new equipment, which will be used to compete with Nova Scotia companies who have already proven they can do the work at a cheaper rate. With that money the NDP could have bought a ferry and brought tourists and investment to Nova Scotia, but rather they are spending $3.6 million of taxpayers' money in Florida.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Thank you, Madam Speaker. My question is for a very busy Minister of Agriculture. Late last month the NDP Government announced it would be spending $500,000 on an engineering study to assess and design a replacement for the LaPlanche River aboiteau. While farmers in this area worry each year about their important land being destroyed by flooding, the NDP Government waited years to commission this study.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Madam Speaker, many in the area are questioning the reasons behind doing the study in the first place. The $500,000 being used to create the assessment could be put to better use by actually going towards replacing the aboiteau. My question to the minister is, why is government wasting more taxpayer money on a study instead of putting the half million dollars towards actually replacing the aboiteau?</p>

          <from>MR. MACDONELL</from>
          <p>MR. MACDONELL : Well I guess firstly, because it's not clear whether or not $500,000 will actually replace the aboiteau. The one that was put in previously by the previous administration, the staff who did that didn't really have the appropriate resources to do it. They kind of nickeled and dimed over three or four years trying to get resources to put that aboiteau in where it was. In less than a year the aboiteau was out and so it really calls for, I think, decisive action and putting the resources in place so we actually can do this and do it right.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : If the Tories couldn't get the job done, I think we can count on the Acadians. This aboiteau protects the Town of Amherst and approximately 1,800 acres of marsh land; land crucial to the farming in this area. Since the minister and the NDP Government are committed to spending this money on the study, they should at least do it in a timely manner. Every Fall, farmers and residents in this region are concerned with flooding; the study and assessment won't be completed until the end of 2012. My question to the minister is, why is it taking another full year to arrange this study?</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : My question is for the Minister of Justice. Recently it has come to the attention of the Annapolis County barrister association that the Department of Justice is seeking to make changes to the dates and times of sittings of Family Court in the county. This would change from the present schedule of two Thursdays a month to a new schedule which would have the court sit on Mondays. The changes would have the number of sitting dates reduced so that in four months of the calendar year in 2012 there is only one court date available. My question to the minister is, will the Minister of Justice confirm whether the department is seeking scheduling changes to the Family Court in Annapolis Royal which would result in the reduction of sitting dates?</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : I thank the member for the question. In regard to the courts and scheduling of the courts, the third arm of the government, being the judiciary, they have the right to set and manage their court processes. Any impact on the community and the community as a whole, the department does take a look at and sees the impact but we respect the fact that there is an independent process there to make decisions on when they sit and how they sit.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : According to the barrister association this has been considered without any consultation, Madam Speaker. It seems the scheduling changes are done without the complete understanding of how the court operates. For many of the litigants who are represented by Nova Scotia Legal Aid and other lawyers who are from Kings and Digby Counties, Monday presents significant scheduling challenges. In addition earned days off for staff are normally taken on Mondays, in fact, to quote a letter from the minister on November 3, 2011: Having Family Courts sit on Mondays in Annapolis Royal is completely and utterly impractical and not workable.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : I believe that there should be consultations in any process with multiple clients and I believe that all sides need to have some flexibility when it comes to scheduling. Looking at efficiencies and workable aspects within any system is critical. We also have to look at what the economic impact each decision has on the province and in the system that is being affected. I encourage people to have open discussion and dialog.</p>

MCNEIL : I'm encouraging the minister to follow the words of his letter that was written to the Annapolis County barrister society and ensure that court will not be sitting on Monday in Annapolis Royal but the present schedule will be maintained until there's meaningful consultation. According to the Annapolis County barrister association sittings in Annapolis Royal typically deals with 10 to 20 cases on any given day. Reducing the numbers of days in which court sits now will dramatically impact on access.</p>

        </speech>

          <from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from>
          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Madam Speaker, certainly blacklegged ticks are an issue of concern in our province. I think there are six areas now identified where these insects are found. Lyme disease is a serious disease that none of us want to see on any of our residents in the province. Basically we've gone from a system of passive surveillance to a system of active surveillance. It allows for a better way to determine whether the tick is located in any neighbourhood. It's certainly the last thing we want to see in any part of our province.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Madam Speaker, people don't appreciate finding things out in the news or the local paper or on the radio. It can cause a little bit of undue hysteria that can be avoided when everyone is properly informed. My question to the minister is, what consultation is the department going to do with the local community on ways to protect themselves from ticks and recognize the warning signs of Lyme disease?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#50073f98-101e-4a05-aef5-b6739b325fb8">
          <from>MR. PARKER</from>
          <p>MR. PARKER : Madam Speaker, as I mentioned, active surveillance is a better way that the department has now to have access to the data, the results, and which communities are impacted by this insect and by this disease. It's a system where our department personnel go out into the various communities around the province and actively dragnet or trap small mammals to find the tick in the neighbourhood. It's a better way to determine the extent of the problem in our province. If the honourable member is interested in a briefing or an update from the department, we could certainly arrange to fill in and get more information for him.</p>

          <from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Madam Speaker, in a rush to get this information out I feel the minister missed a very important step in properly consulting the local people of Yarmouth County. Like I said, it's not just one MLA but two. Gavelton is a beautiful community that has the line going up the middle of it. Part of it is in Yarmouth and part of it is in Argyle, and neither one of those members received any kind of heads-up or briefing or even a forward copy of a press release.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Well, this insect - the blacklegged tick or deer tick - is a concern to all of us in our province. We have consulted with the general public. We've consulted with veterinarians and other doctors and other health care professionals, and we recognize it is a real threat to residents in our province.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Thank you, Madam Speaker. As my colleague, the member for Halifax Clayton Park has articulated, the Liberals have some concerns with this bill, particularly the way it treats people who run U-Vins. We've been through this a number of times. What it does is criminalize people who are running a perfectly legitimate business that offers a service, frequently to people who are not able to haul the containers that hold the alcohol up and down. They perform this service for people in my riding, in the member's riding, and there has been no indication that there is any criminal activity associated with this in any way, shape, or form, yet the government persists in criminalizing what is a legitimate business activity.</p>

The amendment would have allowed the bill to pass, giving the NSLC the power to seek an injunction against any anticipated or actual illegal activity that related to alcohol. At the time, I said I support that kind of power, provided it's going for things that are really detrimental, we're talking about bootlegging or stills in the woods or things that are dangerous to the health and safety and responsible drinking of the public.</p>

At what point do we start giving Crown Corporations the power to go out and act as policemen in their own business? The member for Halifax Clayton Park was quite right when we heard the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage say they lost in court. Well, they did. It was actually a mixed ruling. In fact, that's why there hasn't been any future push forward on that issue because it ended up being a bit of a grey area.</p>

          <from>HON. FRANK CORBETT</from>
          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Madam Speaker, that concludes the government's business for today. Tomorrow is Opposition Day, but the hours will be from noon until 6:00 p.m. I believe the House Leader for the Official Opposition will bring some clarity to that. They will be providing us some time and within that time, we will be calling Public Bills for Second Reading, which will be Bill No. 136 and we'll be doing Committee of the Whole House on Bill Nos. 129 and 133. If the House Leader of the Official Opposition is gracious enough to give us that time, that's what we'll be doing.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, yes, we will complete our Opposition Day business by 4:00 p.m., which will give you two hours to conduct the other business of the House and hopefully move along. Tomorrow we will be calling Resolution Nos. 2886 and 2778. In the spirit of the Christmas season, we're going to forego our late debate tonight. (Interruptions) I move that we now adjourn until the hour of 12:00 noon tomorrow.</p>
