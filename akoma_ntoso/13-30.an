        <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, just on a point of information, it's my understanding that the member for Halifax Atlantic rose on a point of privilege some time ago in this House and I don't believe there has been a ruling on that matter as of yet. In light of how this session is progressing, I'm wondering if the Speaker could advise as to whether we can expect a ruling on that point of privilege by the member for Halifax Atlantic any time soon.</p>

          <p>HON. MAURICE SMITH : Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this week as Road Safety Week. The first thing we need to know is that this week is not selected as Road Safety Week on a whim. Road Safety Week begins in May every year, and that's because more cars are on the road as the snow disappears and the weather warms up.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : I would like to thank the minister for providing a copy of his remarks in advance of today's proceedings. It is my pleasure as well to get up and speak about Road Safety Week. Mr. Speaker, I think we've seen a shift in culture in this province. I know in the rural area that I come from . . .</p>

          <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. MACMASTER : There's lots of Gaelic, yes, and I think in a lot of areas in the province, particularly in rural areas of the province, the incidence of drinking and driving has decreased. I know they are still getting people every week because we see it in the papers but I do believe there has been a cultural shift away from drinking and driving. I know the minister has mentioned some of the partners that he has been working with and I know they do a lot of good advertising. Mr. Speaker, I think the message that is given to the public is plan ahead. If somebody is planning to go out and consume alcohol, plan ahead to make sure that there is a plan in place so that when you go home at the end of the night, there is a safe method to get there, and that is really the answer for that.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. As the Minister of Community Services and the minister responsible for housing, it is my priority to make life better for Nova Scotians through safe and affordable housing. On Monday our government announced the province's very first long-term Housing Strategy. It was an historic day, and caused me to reflect on how central my grandparents' home has been throughout my life. Beginning as a young child visiting with my parents, continuing as a parent myself, raising a child in that same house, and providing the touchstone for my family's life today, I feel so fortunate to live in my grandparents' home with my family. I recognize how this enables my strong and continuing connection to my childhood community.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, sadly, for the past four years the Premier has consistently put the interests of the NDP ahead of Nova Scotians by wastefully spending millions of taxpayer dollars on political advertising. Recently more than $1.1 million has been spent to promote the NDP political advertising campaigns. The Premier has become so out of touch with Nova Scotians that he has chosen political messages over conducting 110 knee surgery replacements, 91 hip surgery replacements, hiring new nurses or doctors, Mr. Speaker.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, much, I'm sure, to the chagrin of the Leader of the Official Opposition, the reality is that the advertising we do is aimed directly at informing Nova Scotians as to the services that they can receive from government offices, whether it happens to be services like Telehealth, like the 811 service, whether it's the use of the Collaborative Emergency Centres in order to get the care that they need in the communities they have. It is advantageous to the people of Nova Scotia to know that they can get better care sooner.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, I can commit to do that because there are none. All of the advertising that we do through the department is aimed at ensuring that people understand the services that they get. In fact, the government is dedicated to ensuring that no matter where you live in the province, no matter what your income level is, you are entitled to the best possible service, and this is particularly true in our education system where it is this government that puts kids and learning first.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, Emera and Nova Scotia Power released their first-quarter 2013 profit results yesterday. Under the NDP's so-called rate stabilization plan Emera's profits are up 41 per cent to $115 million, Nova Scotia Power's profits are up six per cent to $63 million. Under the NDP, Emera has been helped by special NDP legislation to force the URB to approve the Maritime Link within six months; they gave approval to Nova Scotia Power to go ahead with the Maritime Link even before URB approval, and the NDP continues to support their guaranteed return on their profits. So I'll ask the Premier, why has the NDP gone so far out of its way to guarantee such a huge financial windfall to Emera when so many Nova Scotians are struggling to pay their power bills?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know that every time the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party stands up and tries to ask a question like that which is dripping with irony, it must leave a vacant space in him. Of course, it is the Progressive Conservative Party that privatized Nova Scotia Power, it is the Progressive Conservative Party that for 10 years continued to propagate the conditions under which the increases in power which we have seen in this province have continued to perpetuate. It was they that tied us - along with the Liberals, to be fair - to the fossil fuel markets which guaranteed the increases that we see.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the only irony here is that the Premier tells Nova Scotians they have turned the corner but the only ones that have turned the corner in a good way are the shareholders of Emera under his government, that is the sad irony that Nova Scotians see today.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the opposite is actually true. The reality is that the increases in power that we see are related directly to the Progressive Conservative economic policy that was there for a decade. We're changing that policy but the electricity grid, the generation that we have in this province is what it is when you come into power and it takes time for us to be able to rebuild that kind of an energy supply. That is why we need initiatives like Muskrat Falls. It is the Progressive Conservative energy policy which led to the increases you see. It is the policy of this government that led to the immediate 10 per cent decline in power rates, when we took the HST off home energy.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it didn't take much time for the NDP to come in and jack up our power rates by over 30 per cent. It didn't take much time for the NDP to come in and Emera's profits to grow by 41 per cent, but the Premier tells Nova Scotians it's going to take time to deal with their needs, which include jobs and growing earnings and a cheaper electricity but for that the Premier tells them it's going to take time.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday we learned that Nova Scotia Power's parent company's first-quarter profits soared to 53 per cent. This company's profits continue to surge under the NDP Government's failed energy policies, policies that include a new deal for the Maritime Link, a deal that will bind Nova Scotians to rate increases over the next 35 years. My question to the Premier is, why is the Premier so satisfied to allow Nova Scotia Power and Emera to expand their energy monopoly on the backs of Nova Scotia ratepayers?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the energy policy of the province is to pursue a number of different kinds of initiatives in order to make sure that consumers in this province get the lowest and fairest rates. We want a proper energy efficiency program that will allow people to cut their consumption and therefore bring the actual cost of their energy down. It is to get off fossil fuels not only because they cause greenhouse gas emissions, but also because they are extremely volatile.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, one thing we know, it's good for Emera. Many Nova Scotians are questioning whether it's good for Nova Scotia. In the last four years power rates have increased by 30 per cent and the NDP have legislated another 3 per cent increase next year. The Premier likes to pat himself on the back for removing the provincial portion of the HST off home heating, but at the same time the NDP added a tax to every power bill in the Province of Nova Scotia. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier explain to Nova Scotians why he champions Nova Scotia Power and supports their every move, but won't stand up for ratepayers in the province?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition is right about one thing - it was this government that took the HST off of home energy which is the only time it led to an immediate 10 per cent decline in the price of electricity. It is because we have delivered to Nova Scotians not only that particular program, we moved out of government Efficiency Nova Scotia so they could be an independent, arm's-length organization, delivering to Nova Scotians the most efficient way to consume the power that they must consume and save themselves money.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : This government has been sitting on a $58 million deferred federal contribution that was transferred to the province through the social housing transfer. Meanwhile, in March 2013, 1,777 families, 2,518 seniors were on a wait- list for public housing.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, although the Leader of the Official Opposition understands there are transfers, he doesn't obviously understand they are restricted transfers which means they can only be used for specific program initiatives. What we have done is we have developed a multi-faceted plan for housing in Nova Scotia. The creation of Housing Nova Scotia, leveraging the portfolio of the Nova Scotia Housing Development Corporation so that we will, over the next 10 years, put more than $500 million into building various kinds of affordable housing alternatives for people right across the province. This will be one of the most visionary programs with respect to housing in the history of this province.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the social housing transfer, the total amount of transfer coming from CMHC over the next 10 years, plus the deferred federal contribution, equals $470 million. This government has committed to $500 million to its Housing Strategy over the next 10 years; the numbers are pretty close to one another. My question to the Premier is, is the money for the Housing Strategy actually new money or is it money that Nova Scotians were going to receive anyway under the 1997 agreement from our federal partners?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Finally, a good question, I'm glad he asked that one because this is all new money. This will be $500 million of new money which allows us to leverage money from other sources including the federal government, including municipalities, including private investors, including any partners we can find. If there are universities, if there are non-profit groups, we will use this money to leverage with them to provide the kind of housing that people need.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I understand this is very complicated for the Leader of the Official Opposition, he doesn't have any experience in dealing with these kinds of things. The way that program spending works is that we have a Nova Scotia Housing Development Corporation, and they have a very extensive loan portfolio. We're actually able to leverage that portfolio to take money out of it, new money, which will then be used to leverage the federal money from other - money out of the province's portfolio (Interruption) That's right, he's getting it now, I'll speak slowly. The reality is that that money (Interruptions) Do you want me to continue to explain it?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier is trying to convince Nova Scotians that they are about to turn the corner but his own budget projections show more gloom ahead for all Nova Scotians. The budget itself says that unemployment will grow in each of the next two years - 9 per cent this year, 9.1 per cent next year, 9.2 per cent the year after that and it says that employment, our labour force, will decline next year. That's not exactly what Nova Scotians mean when they say they want to truly turn the corner.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that none of those agencies have said any such thing. Even the Auditor General, as the Premier well knows, doesn't actually express an opinion on the bottom line of the budget and when it's balanced, so let's turn to the common sense of everyday Nova Scotians. They are the ones the Premier should really be concerned about. What they see is that the budget projects that our population is going to decline next year by 0.1 per cent but somehow magically HST revenue, the take the government has out of the pockets of all Nova Scotians, is going to go up by 6.8 per cent, adding another $80 million to the bottom line, a nonsensical conclusion in a declining population.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, in fact what the budget actually does is it projects the fact that the labour force will expand, that the level of income will be higher and, of course, as a result of that, the level of spending will continue to increase, as it does every year.</p>

In 2009, the government made it law to report emergency room closures annually to the House, but 18 months elapsed between the 2010 report and the 2011 report.

Seniors in Cape Breton are waiting up to three years for placement in a long-term care facility. More than one year after this government's physician resource plan was introduced, ERs are still closing and Nova Scotians are still waiting to find their own family doctor.

The process is unfolding as it should. It's going to give Nova Scotia a great opportunity - not only to have hydroelectricity from Newfoundland and Labrador but really opening up opportunities for us to look at other renewable sources like wind power, tidal power, and sustainable biomass.

The 2012 Nova Scotia Breast Screening Program Annual Report shows 11 fixed sites for the digital mammography units across the province. This provision provides an opportunity to increase screening capacity at those sites and that's something we all are very proud of and happy to hear.

That is why there has been a process in place. Even when the member opposite was a former minister, she would have known about some of the advancements that have been working with the program to try to get all 11 fixed sites to have the digital mammography.

The key is to ensure that people have access to the most up-to-date technology. That's why the investment over the last decade has been to try to target those fixed sites, to make sure they have the digital mammography units on them. We've seen, and the evidence has shown, we've collected all the data on the use of the mobile unit, that the use of the mobile units has declined significantly over the years because of the use of the old analog units that were on that site. Often, many of the tests, once those analog films were delivered to the fixed sites for development, they would have to require that individual to come back to a fixed site because there was an error, it wasn't good positioning.</p>

When announcing this review would be extended, this government made a point of citing numerous expert reports that were published that needed adequate time to review, including a 2001 Sierra Club Atlantic study and 2011 reports from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, Duke University, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The errors are not limited to delayed decisions; they're also seen in rushed, knee-jerk reactions. The short-sighted decision to cancel the funding for the Yarmouth ferry has been shown to be the wrong decision. The amount of government funding to the area since the ferry was cancelled is roughly the amount that would have been needed to keep it going.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we're very proud of is that we have increased access for women across this province not only to a faster breast screening but also to new technology, which means that the work being done is being done more quickly and with greater accuracy. This work was done in conjunction with the Canadian Breast Cancer Society who recommended the approach that is being followed, and endorsed the approach being followed by the Department of Health and Wellness. I'm sure, or at least I would hope, that the member for Preston would not suggest that those who work so hard to ensure that women who get the services that they need would somehow try to disadvantage one community over another.</p>

The NDP denied Capital Health permission to end the subsidy to Tim Hortons' cafeterias on three separate occasions. Capital Health said they expected to see $1.4 million in losses from their food services, and I will table that article from CTV Atlantic. There are some money pits and Capital Health tried three times to allow someone to take over these operations. Visitors, health care workers and patients really don't care who runs the Tim Hortons. What matters to Nova Scotians is when money is irresponsibly taken from front-line health care.</p>

When we came into government we knew that we had to try to harness the health care budget. We needed to ensure that it was sustainable going into the future; it wasn't sustainable when we took over in 2009 - costs were running away from us.

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I want to bring an update on Fenwick MacIntosh because I did have a meeting this morning discussing a look at the overall events that occurred. This matter goes for over 30 to 40 years when you look at the total of the incidents. When I look back in the 1990s when the Public Prosecution first became aware of this matter - we're asking them to go back now that certain results came out from the federal court, to go back and examine what has occurred and to give us a report. In fairness and respect to them and their service, to do that analysis and to look at their files, to form concrete opinions and positions on what occurred and what didn't occur and to present me with the facts, will take some time.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, the victims, for them and the horrible price they've paid, they want to see this matter scrutinized. The fact that government appears to be delaying that scrutiny is troubling for them and it causes them to further mistrust government.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Once again, I apologize to you, Mr. Speaker, and to this House for not being clear in saying that in all due respect of the complexities of this issue, it is incumbent upon me as the Attorney General to ensure that I give people who are in positions of authority and responsibility time for them to read their documents so that when they do make a presentation to me before a decision can be made, that it's to the best of their knowledge taking into consideration all access to information that they have and then present that.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I don't think this matter is overly complicated. Many people know the chronology of events that happened - there are just a few blanks that need to be filled in. I do believe this is something that the Public Prosecution Service knows right now what happened and I believe they should be coming forth with it. Asking for a report to be due when the Legislature is no longer sitting, which is what the minister has asked for, is not a great way to show transparency. Tomorrow might very well be our last day here in the Legislature. (Interruptions) Well, this is an example of an important matter that should be scrutinized in the Legislature.</p>

          <p>HON. MAURICE SMITH : Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the question. I think we've discussed this particular piece of highway construction several times now, in the last session and earlier in this session. Realizing the time that's left, I will indicate that the plan for that particular stretch of highway that you talk about, that has been talked about by the member, will be completed this construction season. The tender will go out in time to have that done. That, I can tell you, is a guarantee.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : That's quite the spin to put on what took place, Mr. Speaker, to say the least. The fact is that this is probably one of the most dangerous sections of road in Cape Breton right now and I'm sure if you've travelled on Route 4 through Hay Cove and Red Islands, you would know that this road is clearly in disastrous condition, it's one where we're just biding time as to when there's going to be a serious accident on that section of road, because of the condition of it.</p>

Make sure that I adhere to the Clerk's request. This bill is basically a copy of what has been already adopted by the Ontario Government in 2004, where it's called the Ontario Government Advertising Act. The purpose of this bill would be to impose requirements on ads, printed matter, and additional classes of messages; require the Auditor General to review submission prior to publication; and clarifies what is partisan and rests that decision with the Auditor General. I should point out, as well, for the interest of members of the government that the New Democratic Party of British Columbia recently introduced a similar bill in their Legislature. So obviously this has piqued the interest of their counterparts in British Columbia.</p>

One of the things I do want to mention, a few notes, just as I was listening to the honourable member for Richmond - one in particular around being stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. This government is the government that no longer uses March madness as a way to spend things. In fact, in one year when the Progressive Conservatives were in power, anywhere between $350,000 and $400,000 of unbudgeted spending (Interruptions) $300 million to $400 million in unbudgeted spending, and that's a record of this government contrasting the former Progressive Conservative Government.</p>

Any Nova Scotian, from any walk of life, is fit to serve in this Legislature and for any member to stand in this House and suggest that somebody by virtue of running a small business, being a tradesperson, being a farmer, being a fisherman, whatever, is not suited, being a mother, being a stay-at-home mother, being a student, being a social worker, shouldn't be here, like the member for Cape Breton South who was a social worker for many years, shouldn't sit in this Legislature - that's shameful.

If government dollars are going to be used to fund advertising - and there are very important things that are funded by advertising. If you look and you say that flu shots are available, for example, it's important to let people know that flu shots are available. It was interesting, though, that when the people responsible for this, Communications Nova Scotia, were before Public Accounts Committee, one of the things that they were asked about is, traditionally in the advertising world you put tags on the end of Web site addresses. The Province of Nova Scotia always did that under previous governments, different ones for each ad so you can track the success of each individual ad. They've stopped doing that. They don't have any way to track the success of those ads, because they all direct to the same Web site.</p>

          <from>MR. GARY RAMEY</from>
          <p>MR. GARY RAMEY : Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in the House today to speak to this very important issue. Just yesterday, this House of Assembly became aware that a critical piece of the Liberal Party's energy plan had been a monumental failure in New Brunswick. Yesterday the New Brunswick Government admitted, publicly, what they'd been reporting for almost two years - deregulation and an open energy market in their province simply have not worked.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to stand this evening and speak to the resolution that stands before us. It's kind of funny, when the member for Lunenburg West started things off and tried to sort of talk about all the good things that this government is trying to do, you know when a reporter asked the NDP Leader if his plan would really lower rates - what was his answer? His answer was no, his plan doesn't do that for Nova Scotians, even though we do pay the highest power rates in all of Canada.</p>
