          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Yesterday members of the Law Amendments Committee heard from a large number of young Nova Scotians who object to the elimination of the Graduate Retention Rebate. I think one young Nova Scotian, Robert Parker, put it best when he said, "Given the disappointing results since the Ivany report came out, even those of us who are most committed to living and working in Nova Scotia are thinking about whether it makes sense to stay, and for how long."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think what most of the presenters said yesterday is that the program, the GRR program, did not do what it was intended to do. What they were actually concerned about was the fact that all that money was not put back into reducing tuition or rebate programs.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, in fact what we heard over and over again last night from our young, best and brightest, is that they feel betrayed by this government which cancelled the Graduate Retention Rebate program with nothing to take its place. In fact, they are looking for jobs.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that is one of the most pathetic questions I've ever heard in this House. This government will continue to work with the business community across this province to provide good opportunities for university and community college graduates to stay and work in this province.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, what is pathetic is that a whole group of young Nova Scotians, our best and brightest, had to come down to Province House and demand action from a government that has two sessions of this House under its belt, and six months, and a road map to success from the Ivany report, that sits back and does nothing but disappoint them and listen to them tell the government that they are betrayed by a government that cancels their one hope of a job here, that gives young Nova Scotians the highest tax increase in our province's history. That is what is pathetic.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what we have done is invested in young Nova Scotians. We've broadened the apprenticeship opportunities in this province. For decades people have been telling us we had to do something about apprenticeship opportunities in this province. In six months we delivered for the people of this province. Young Nova Scotians who want to do research have had to leave this province and go to Ontario and other parts of Canada. We've delivered for those university graduates.</p>

What we're going to take instead of an administrative-focused health care system, we're going to make sure it's focused on patients.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my office has obtained, through the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, and I'll table it, a briefing note regarding amalgamation costs. The Department of Health and Wellness has identified a whole slew of early costs associated with DHA amalgamation - consultant costs, staff costs, travel costs, information technology and systems change costs, including SAP requirements - and we know that could end up being a bit expensive - polling and communication costs, new board costs, and severance costs. These are the early costs.</p>

His plan is going to add to the administrative costs of health care in the province. The Minister of Health and Wellness has repeatedly said that he could not provide an estimate of the cost of the DHA amalgamation because estimates have not yet been developed, but that same briefing note says there are estimates for all the categories that I have outlined today and the briefing note indicates the financial component has been approved.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. It turns out that Nova Scotia's manufacturing exports fell again last month and are now down almost 9 per cent over the past year - and I will table that for the benefit of the House. That is the worst performance in all of Canada. The Ivany report specifically says we should focus on manufacturing jobs because those are good jobs. They hear the Premier saying that's not his problem, that's up to the private sector.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think if he actually continued to read the Ivany report, what it says is those decisions should not be made by Cabinet; they should be made by an arm's-length board of business leaders. That's why we've created Invest Nova Scotia and that is why we're expanding the opportunity for NSBI to respond to that.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, here are some decisions that have been made by the Cabinet under the new government: we pay the highest taxes in the country, the young graduates got the biggest tax increase - 275 per cent - in our province's history; they're going to drive our provincial debt up by another $0.5 billion this year and $1 billion in total under their mandate using their own budget numbers. Those are decisions made by the Cabinet that they take ownership of but when it comes to implementing the Ivany report, a road map to turn our economy around, they are hands-off and say no, that's for somebody else to do.</p>

The economy in Nova Scotia has been stalled for years and we obviously need a jump start. Statistics Canada released its regional data that shows a three-month moving average for labour force characteristics. In Cape Breton over the last five years, as of March 2014, population has decreased by 5,900; labour force has decreased by 2,800.

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. The Canadian Institute for Health Information, or CIHI, has noted that health care administrative cost ratios have been declining in Nova Scotia, from 6.3 per cent in 2008-09 to an estimated 4.59 per cent in 2013. That's a 2 per cent decrease in four years that the cost of Nova Scotia's health administration has been reduced, in fact, to the levels of other provinces in the country.</p>

One of the notes that the member opposite has made is a catalogue of areas in which some costs can be incurred during the restructuring process. But one of the great discoveries that I have made that perhaps the former minister hadn't, and that is the great expertise that is in our province, in our Department of Health and Wellness - we are not using any outside consultants.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, that is very good to know, but there are a slew of other costs associated with this amalgamation - it's here in this briefing note in black and white. The Minister of Health and Wellness has been attempting to downplay the cost of consolidating health boards suggesting it will be minimal.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, we are taking a very thoughtful and strategically planned move into the one or two health boards, the IWK and the provincial board. We don't plan to do it all in one year. We're going to respect a lot of the good number of the leaders in our health care system and allow attrition to assist us, which will be a big part of moving towards a smaller number of administrators throughout the province. So whether it will be two or three years to accomplish that, that's up to the transition and advisory group who have now started their work under the very capable direction and leadership of former CEO Pat Lee.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, Alberta, New Brunswick, and now Nova Scotia's own experience under the last Liberal Government has shown that the costs of health administration rise under health care reorganization schemes.

We've allowed Pat Lee to provide a great deal of work over the next four months on giving us the final structure.

For a long time we've been dealing with issues, especially with the Centennial Building. This was a bit of a disturbing trend though and I think the communication issue that was underlying is one that will continue to be important for the minister because I believe he needs to know things are happening when they are happening, not a couple of days late, which I think is what happened in both of these instances right now.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, one of the approaches that is being taken immediately at the QEII is taking a look at all of the units in terms of their physical environment while they also do some staff assessment. This will be an ongoing challenge to make sure that a deteriorating environment is looked after as fully as possible to make sure that people's stay, long or short, does not have to deal with the issues that we have had in the last couple of weeks.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : It seems like it was just yesterday, but it was quite some time ago when we were having problems in the transition unit in that same building, where it did get closed down and the patients got transferred to other units in the system. I'm wondering, is there an opportunity to re-look at the way we're providing care, especially when it comes to the Centennial Building, so that outbreaks like rodents and mice and scabies will not continue to plague our system, and to allow surgeries and procedures to be done in our health care system? We can't allow these things to happen, so that our system doesn't continue to get bogged down with those kinds of issues.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to first of all thank the honourable member for reviewing some of the messages that I've been trying to deliver over the last seven years. I want to thank him for the question. It's a very serious issue that many Nova Scotians are feeling the cost of the rise of gasoline in this province. It's why, when I meet with the Premiers of Atlantic Canada in May, I've committed to talking about decoupling the tax so that we do not charge the HST on top of the motive fuel tax here in Atlantic Canada. I'm looking forward to having that conversation on behalf of Nova Scotians.</p>

          <from>MR. DAVID WILSON</from>
          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Now that the Liberals are in power, the Premier has changed his tune once again. On Friday the Premier suggested in The Chronicle Herald that the only way to move forward with changes to gas pricing in Nova Scotia is to go at it with the other Maritime Provinces - the answer the Premier just gave. But, Mr. Speaker, once again I'll remind the Premier that when he was in Opposition he said that the only thing we have any control over at all - that's our province that he was talking about - is the gas tax charge on a litre of gas. This is just another example that the Premier was saying one thing prior to the election and doing something else when he is in government.</p>

With all seriousness, as I've said to this House, I will be talking to the other Atlantic Premiers in May, when I meet with them in New Brunswick, to look at decoupling the HST from motive fuel tax in this province, which in my view would not only provide relief to the motoring public but I think it's the right thing for Atlantic governments to do, in conjunction with the federal government.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, all we are trying to do is make sure that Nova Scotians understand the true position of the government. We know their position in Opposition; it's a little different now in government. Even the Premier's own Finance and Treasury Board Minister doesn't agree with him. She said in the same article that I just tabled that it would be really irresponsible to start rebating taxes or changing our tax system in a way that would just put us deeper in the hole.</p>

I certainly want to recognize the anxiety and upheaval that these circumstances are presenting to the residents in this community. The purpose of the Residential Tenancies Act is to provide efficient and cost-effective means for dispute resolution. The Act specifically outlines what's required of landlords in their dealings with tenants and the options available to landlords - and the circumstances that my colleague has presented are, in fact, accurate.</p>

As I understand, residents can file an application to ensure they get the required 12 months.

I don't believe this is any way to treat people, to just come out and try to evict people in only a short time of six weeks. Will the minister confirm for those residents today, as he has his past two answers, will the minister confirm that he will use the laws found in the Residential Tenancies Act to protect them for at least the next 12 months so that they have proper time to make arrangements for a new home?</p>

The points being made are very appropriate and I think the bottom line here is that to give legal eviction notices to close these land-lease communities, or any community where there is a tenancy-landlord agreement, the landlord would be required to make that application through the process. I can assure my colleague in Opposition and the residents of this land-lease community that we will apply the legislation as it was intended, to protect the best interest of those homeowners and tenants.</p>

Mr. Speaker, the community of Eskasoni was in distress back in 2008 after a series of youth suicides. With the assistance of the federal and provincial governments at the time, a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week crisis line was established.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I wonder if it would be fair to say that if Ms. McDonough was on the floor of this House and had seen a member try to move from second reading to third reading such as that, she may have been "shocked and appalled" to see a majority Liberal Government trying to abuse the parliamentary process in such a way. Fortunately she's here overseeing to make sure that does not happen today and I'm happy to report we will proceed to the Private and Local Bills Committee and then bring it back for third reading.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : I'm coming to that. But prior to that, and prior to that development, going back to 1758 when the penal laws were in effect, Catholics could not sit in this Legislature; they could not vote; they could not purchase land and their children couldn't be educated in their faith. So what standing did these people have in society before that was changed? If they did violate any of those measures, they could have their goods confiscated. On a second offence they could face punishment of banishment and on a third offence they could receive punishment of death.</p>

I think the broader issues are important and I think the out-sourcing issue in particular is as much a strain on the families of people who don't know whether they are going to be out-sourced or not, as it is on anything else, and we'll see where that goes. I have my own opinions on where it might go, but they're probably, on that particular issue, as good as anybody else's opinion in here and my understanding is in the next few months we might have some certainty on when, if, and how much - all that sort of thing happens.</p>

          <p>MR. KEITH IRVING : Mr. Speaker, it's my pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to Bill No. 51 and specifically to the amendments that were brought forward on Bill No. 51. As the honourable member across spoke about, the village commissions, through legislation, are required to lease or sell or donate land to non-profit organizations at fair market value. There are situations where this is a disadvantage for a village looking to work with a non-profit group. The member opposite raised the issue in my constituency of New Minas, where this became an issue.</p>

          <p>MR. JOHN LOHR : I would like to speak against this bill for several reasons. First of all, I think that we have in our province a grape industry and a winery industry that is just starting to really get going, and I question the impact that u-vints will have on that winery industry. What will happen is that the brewing that is done in the u-vints will result in a $3 bottle of wine, and at that low price I'm afraid it will impact the grape and wine industry, the wineries that we have in the province.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to make a few brief comments. I know, especially after the comments from the minister on third reading of Bill No. 52, she had mentioned that there will be continued consultation as the regulations are created for this piece of legislation. I would hope and I would encourage - and I look hopefully to support from this recommendation from the Minister of Health and Wellness - that the minister look at consultation with those professionals who have worked their whole career in public health, and similar to some of the comments from the previous speaker, that there is an impact on society when there is access to a lower-cost alcohol.</p>

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from the other members who have spoken. I wanted to make a few comments about what we've heard here from the Opposition. First of all, in our original consultation we did have input from the wine industry. Nova Scotia's wine industry is in no way threatened by the access to u-vint operations. They are outselling everything they make. The entire production is sold. There isn't enough to export at this point because it's all absorbed and sold here in Nova Scotia. People are appreciating the wine industry.</p>

It took years and years to be diagnosed, and what I'll bet we'll find in 10 years from now is that some of us will maybe be sitting here and that we'll be adapting the rules and regulations of what the State of Maine and other states are doing.</p>
