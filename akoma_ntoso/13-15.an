The province is also renewing its efforts to find an operator to run a ferry service in Yarmouth.</p>

          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment now to talk a little bit about a topic that is at the top of minds for many people these days. Energy is an issue that has steadily risen as a priority for Nova Scotians, whether you're talking about power rates, energy conservation or switching to cleaner, more renewable forms of energy. It is an issue that transcends borders and requires provincial leaders to work together to come up with solutions that strengthen our energy infrastructure and build a better future for families and businesses across the region. I have worked closely on this file, in my time as Premier, and more recently as the chairman of the Council of the Federation.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I am in receipt of the statement on the national pipeline potential - although apparently from both previous statements, today's discussion has nothing to do with the national pipeline opportunity that is before us and everything to do with about 12 other things, which is a real shame because a national pipeline company has actually put out a real expression of interest to ship Alberta oil across the country to Eastern Canada. It is an opportunity that is worthy of debate in this House, and I wish we'd actually have that discussion instead of the "mud fest" that I just watched going back and forth between the other two Parties.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : It's an honour to stand as a former paramedic and now as Minister of Health and Wellness for the Province of Nova Scotia. I know that Nova Scotians are passionate about the quality of health care here in the province. They want to know that, no matter where they live, they will have access to high quality health care, close to home. They want to know that they can find a family doctor without having to travel two hours for every appointment. They want to know that if they have chest pain in the middle of the evening, or the night, they can get emergency care in their community, and they will not take no for an answer nor should they.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to thank the minister for an advance copy of his statement. Fortunately, there was absolutely nothing new in the statement today - I guess it's a day of statements by ministers - that the general public hasn't already been inundated with, in the form of hundreds of thousands of dollars in television advertising. In fact, a little bit of tweaking of this statement sounds eerily similar to the statement read by the former minister last year.</p>

It is my pleasure to stand for a few moments and speak to the remarks of the Minister of Health and Wellness, and I want to thank him for his advance copy of that. Matter of fact, probably, had we looked a little deeper, it would have been pretty close to the same statement made by the previous minister, about a year ago, talking about all the good things about CECs.</p>

          <from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : My question is for the Premier. Just moments ago evidence filed on behalf of the Consumer Advocate and Small Business Advocate and the Maritime Link experts in the field - recognized world experts in the field - asked the question: "Are you satisfied the ML project is the lowest long-term cost alternative for electricity ratepayers in Nova Scotia . . ." The answer was: "No. While we are satisfied that the ML imports are consistent with the obligations under the Electricity Act and under the Environment Act, we believe that the Applicant has not demonstrated that the ML project represents the lowest long-term cost alternative for ratepayers in the Province. Based on our detailed review of the Applicant's economic analysis of the ML project versus alternative projects, we conclude that the Applicant's analysis was faulty, lacking in robustness, incompletely documented, and biased to favor the Applicant's desired outcome."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I have not seen what has been filed but I can tell you this, John Dalton is a world renowned expert, respected across jurisdictions, who has done a detailed, minute-by-minute analysis of what it will save ratepayers in this province, almost a half a billion dollars less over its nearest competitor. That is a real savings into the pockets of the people of Nova Scotia. That I know.</p>

          <from>MR. YOUNGER</from>
          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, the Premier should be careful what he says because these three international experts agree and let me continue, they say: "The Applicant has based this assertion on very small, perhaps insignificant differences, between two very large numbers . . . we conclude that the Indigenous Wind alternative and a variant of the Other Import alternative are less expensive than ML under all of the cases we tested. Moreover, the Indigenous Wind and Other Import alternatives have the important added benefits of flexibility, diversity, and a scaleable capital outlay. A large, long-term, iron-clad financial commitment to the ML project will preclude the Province's ability to react and respond to future changes in load, technical progress, and evolving environmental goals."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, it has never been clearer than it is today that the Liberal Party stands against Atlantic Canada, stands against progress on real fairness in electricity rates. They don't want to have the Maritime Link go forward. They don't want to endorse Atlantic Canadian strategy for the lowest and fairest electricity rates.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : The only person in this room who is against domestic energy is this Premier because three experts have said that wind in Nova Scotia would be cheaper than Maritime Link. Three experts have said that other imports would be cheaper than Maritime Link, and Mr. Speaker, the final quote in this, which I tabled says, "The ML transaction also shortchanges Nova Scotia ratepayers in at least two ways." Will the Premier now agree to lengthen the review process as the interveners asked for and admit that he failed?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, one year has passed since the tragic death in Halifax of Raymond Taavel. This anniversary reminds us that it takes only one tragedy to demand real change to protect the public, and when that demand comes, the need is urgent.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : In fact, Mr. Speaker, action is underway on all of the recommendations. Some have been completed. We are looking forward to having the rest of them dealt with. It's a very important issue and a very important question. Today I'd like to have the Minister of Health and Wellness fill the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party in further on the work that has taken place.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, there's a lot of people working in different departments to ensure the 18 recommendations - that we will fully implement all of them. We've committed to a timetable that we just updated for Nova Scotians. It's on the Web site. They can see the updates and where we are with the 18 recommendations. It's our hope that we'll have all 18 recommendations implemented around September of this year.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, let me remind you of this government's history on meeting its own timelines. That joint review was supposed to be a 30-day review in urgent response to the murder of Raymond Taavel. It took the government seven months to complete the review. It contains 18 specific recommendations.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, as I said in my initial comments to the member opposite, I think everybody in this House recognizes the importance of ensuring that there's public safety when it comes to those individuals who find themselves at the Forensic Unit. I recently took a tour to get an additional update on how we're doing within the facility itself, so those recommendations that deal with the facilities are being implemented. One of them was the access to a smoking area within the facility - that should be operational within days. I was over there a couple of weeks ago seeing that.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'll tell you who's paying very close attention and that is the Taavel family themselves, the family that was stricken by tragedy, and so are all Nova Scotians paying attention when tragedy occurs and they look to the government to provide a strong and immediate response. It is not good enough for the government to sit idly by and study proven recommendations for months and months at a time when the safety of typical Nova Scotians who are walking our streets is at risk - even the safety of those patients of the East Coast Forensic Centre. They all need action.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I guess we have a different definition of "forever" because the Progressive Conservatives were in government for 10 years and they did nothing on this, forever; in fact, for the entire time of their government they did nothing on this whatsoever. It was this government that appointed the expert panel, that got the recommendations, and is implementing it.</p>

We recognized the anniversary of his death today, a tragedy for not only his family and those who loved him, but for the community and the province. The Justice Minister and myself met with representatives for the Taavel family recently so that we could update them on our progress. We've committed to them, we've committed to the public, that we would be very transparent and open; that's why the update is on our Web site right now for all Nova Scotians to see how quickly we're moving to implement all these recommendations.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday outside of the Chamber the Premier spoke about reducing wait times from well over a year to four months. While this is admirable, the problem is the Premier was talking about reducing wait times for assessments - and not wait times for actual programs which may be required as a result of this assessment.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we're not satisfied at all; in fact, we're not satisfied with the manner in which mental health in this province has been handled for many, many years, and that is why this government chose to bring in a mental health strategy. Not only did we go out, consult with the stakeholders, talk to organizations around the province, who until now had been handed the responsibility for assisting in the field of mental health but had done so without the proper funding, we brought in the strategy and we brought in the funding to implement the strategy.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, that is funding that they have under spent while they were handing out record amounts of corporate welfare. On May 12th the Liberal Health Critic informed this government that the IWK ACT program was no longer doing pre-admissions due to the fact that those coming into the program would have to wait until the Fall or winter of 2013 before they could actually access the program.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well first of all, Mr. Speaker, I don't want the Leader of the Official Opposition to inadvertently mislead the House. No money was under spent with respect to mental health. The mental health strategy came in in May. The budget was $5.2 million so it was prorated over the year so the full amount of the budget was spent, as it will be this year, in order to make sure that we have the most effective programming possible. What I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition is that before someone can get into a program, they actually have to have an assessment, so pulling down the assessment wait times, of course, is a good thing.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I hope the Premier realizes how ridiculous that statement sounds to families. Somehow, by pulling down an assessment and telling families who already know that the young people in their family need help, by somehow telling them they magically created an assessment is going to make everything better without putting them into treatment, is absolutely ridiculous and offensive to families across this province.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : What is now clear is the extraordinary lack of judgment in the Leader of the Official Opposition. The assessment tools that are put in place in order to assess people for the kind of treatment they need is absolutely critical in their treatment. In fact, nothing else can happen until the assessment takes place. For the Leader of the Official Opposition in this House to suggest that the assessments are unnecessary is, in fact, ridiculous.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, one more time the Premier distorts anything that has been said in this House. Last year the NDP Government made an unprecedented interference into what was supposed to be the independent process to redraw the electoral boundaries of this province. From the outset, and for every step of the way, the Premier, through his actions and the actions of his government, discredited this important process. After losing their representation, the Acadian Federation of Nova Scotia is now asking the Premier to send the question of constitutionality to the Supreme Court, as a reference case. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier send this question to the Supreme Court for an independent analysis of the constitutionality of removing minority ridings?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : The terms of reference support minority representation. They, in fact, support drawing of boundaries that recognize the very important cultural history of our province. I believe that there is a report that was done independently. We did not interfere with it. In fact, we simply support the recommendations that come forward. The answer, with respect to the reference, is no, we will not.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the request from the federation should come as no surprise to the Premier. Acadians from across the province have been disappointed by the political interference from this Premier during the whole process. The Premier's interference resulted in the elimination of the Acadian ridings. So my question to the Premier is, why is the Premier refusing clarification from the Supreme Court on whether the elimination of the Acadian ridings is even constitutional?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I have no idea what the Leader of the Official Opposition is talking about. The fact of the matter is that those ridings are still there. The boundaries have changed, as they must. They now fit into the 25 per cent variation, which they should do.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : One thing is clear, it was wrong for the Premier to interfere and politicize the redistribution of a Nova Scotia riding. Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians had an independent process with all-Party support, until the Premier took action to ensure that the Acadian ridings were eliminated.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : To be perfectly clear, Mr. Speaker, there was no interference with the Electoral Commission, none whatsoever. In fact, they were simply asked to produce a report that conformed to the terms of reference, which they were handed by the House of Assembly. That's what they were, and you can ask anybody and they will say that that is what they did.</p>

MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure both ministers would agree - and I know they are both involved because it is both a Justice and a Health matter - I'm sure both ministers would agree that being on the street at 2:00 a.m. in an environment near bars where there is alcohol and quite possibly drugs being consumed is probably not the best place for somebody who is being treated for mental illness. A GPS bracelet would help medical professionals ensure patients return to the hospital, when their unescorted period of leave has finished.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, thank you for that question. I just want to reiterate that from a Justice perspective, in the 18 recommendations there are five specific ones that are directed at Justice, which we have completed. As the Minister of Justice, I'm very committed to safety and to making sure that our process systems work. I agree with the member when we talk about being out where there are drugs and booze is not a good place to be. I do say that our police officers do an excellent job and that on this issue here, we're committed to fulfilling the requirements in the 18 recommendations. We are focused on that and I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making. We would like it to be done tomorrow but we realize that things take time, and to get a good job done, we should do it right.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, we feel the police are doing a good job, as well, but we do feel that they need the tools to do the best job possible. We know this is not about money because the health authority has hired a community monitor to track patients on unescorted leave. That's something that wasn't even included in the recommendations but that is something that has happened. We also know that they've explored the possibility of using cellphones and pagers - and I'll table that - to monitor patients while on leave.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I think some of the victims of cyberbullying, and the victims who have seen photos of themselves being passed on the Internet, might find it interesting to be told that funding that was made available for police training has been cut and instead is now being counted as good management. This is a very serious issue and that is why we raised it when we asked the minister to explain why police training funding has not been increased. We know that the investigative work of police is changing every day. We need to make sure that our police have the necessary funds to keep up with this training so that their investigative techniques can be up-to-date. So my question, again, to the Minister of Justice, or whomever he wants to pass it off to, is why is this government not ensuring that all monies budgeted for police training actually get spent on police training?</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : I want to thank the member for framing his question in a sarcastic manner. I will rise above that and answer the question in a way. The issue here is that policing is a municipal responsibility in the province and the Justice Department is extremely honoured and pleased to be a partner with them in providing support for training. Each department is required to develop business plans and strategic plans for the short term and the long term in delivering training. If the various departments have a particular need, then they should put their business case forward so that can be appropriately addressed, but I want to assure all police officers in Nova Scotia that this minister is 100 per cent, unequivocally dedicated to their support and development, and should they have a particular need or void in their training, I am committed to meeting that, unequivocally.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Once again, Mr. Speaker, rather than leading and working with police departments, offering new training and new techniques, we see the minister saying, we're ready to follow, so you bring forward your proposals and then we'll make the decision at that point. We have heard from police departments the fact that this province used to be a leader, through the Department of Justice, working with municipal police forces, ensuring that training was up to standard, yet over the last number of years that has been cut and instead we hear the Minister of Justice saying, come ask for money, we don't have any thoughts on how additional training could take place. But if the minister is saying that all of this money is still waiting there, will he stand in his place and confirm that his department has not rejected any applications from municipal police forces for additional training in the last three fiscal years?</p>

It is also intended that they will continue to be competitive, which is the key component, because if not they would close and closing would mean that all of the suppliers to that plant would go out of business.</p>

MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, a story published in The ChronicleHerald on Saturday describes the consequences that the public dollar involvement will have on E&amp;R Langille Contracting Limited of New Glasgow. The 34-year-old forestry operation employs 84 people, but because of the direct investment, that involvement, they'll be forced to let close to 20 people go - and will obviously lose revenue as well. In addition, the company has been denied government support via loans based on the fact that it would create an unfair advantage, but it seems as though the government has now put them at somewhat of a disadvantage.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course we look at all aspects of any investments that are made, we want them to have a net impact that is positive. Obviously in this case some of the work will go in-house which will make Northern more competitive, better able to supply their markets.

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, three years ago last month, legislation was passed by all members of the Legislature around expanding the scope of practice for pharmacists. Included in this scope were changes that would allow pharmacists to administer flu vaccines. These changes were welcomed by all members of the House and according to the words of the minister of the day: This was good for patients and creates efficiencies in the health care system. My question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, could he tell us why, after debating this bill in the 2010 session of the Legislature, why a pharmacist was still unable to administer a flu vaccine this past flu season?</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We're working extremely hard to ensure that all clinicians around the province can work to their full scope of practice. We recognize the importance of pharmacists to the health care system. We've been working with them and negotiating with them, with PANS - interestingly enough, I'm sure the member will be with them later this evening, at their reception - to come up with an agreement to ensure that there's compensation for pharmacists when they enter into providing that service for Nova Scotians. I look forward to them participating in the upcoming flu season by providing vaccines for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, pharmacists provide valuable services to our communities. The Fair Drug Pricing Act was passed in this House, which required pharmacists to cut back out of necessity on services they were providing to the public, especially valuable services to our seniors. Changes to the Pharmacy Act in 2010 provided an opportunity to replace these services with other services, which in 2010 would, in the words of the minister, create efficiencies in the health care system.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The government is allowing Capital Health to unfairly discriminate against small-business owners providing blood collection services to elderly and vulnerable people in their homes. The coming changes will require all blood samples to be transported to the Mackenzie Building in Halifax within 90 minutes. The small-business owners often work in Cole Harbour or Sackville or Dartmouth and throughout the HRM. Requiring them to cover the costs of a courier to Halifax unfairly discriminates against those living outside the city centre.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, in the time that it takes to get it in is the challenge that they have. Small-business owners will have to nearly double their fees to cover the cost of a courier, because they now need to get a courier rather than bring it in themselves.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I want to be very clear to Nova Scotians and to the member opposite - we, the government, we are not charging individuals. These are private companies, and we've seen a large increase in them over the last number of years that are charging patients. We do not charge for blood collections when people go into Cobequid Health Centre or the Dartmouth General. We know that we have to ensure that we can have continuity when it comes to the tests.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer. Last week the minister told reporters that it was up to the small-business owners to transition to new business models to adapt to the inevitable change. Once he was done trivializing the roles of these small businesses, he mused about the possibility of Capital Health seizing the opportunity to collect blood samples from people at home. Not only does the minister not really care about their fixed budgets or that they live outside the city, but now he's entertaining the idea of maybe putting those small businesses out of work completely.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, on March 28th, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, in collaboration with the National Advisory Council on Prescription Drug Misuse, released a national strategy to address the harms associated with prescription drugs. This strategy titled, First Do No Harm, was developed with two Nova Scotians from the Department of Health and Wellness, as well as the Kentville Police Chief Mark Mander on the team. It laid out a comprehensive, five-point plan to deal with the issue of prescription drug abuse and misuse. Could the Minister of Health and Wellness tell us whether his department plans to proceed with the implementation of this strategy?</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm disturbed by the cases of prescription drugs that we've seen in the province. I think all Nova Scotians, all members of the House, want to ensure that we don't see that happen in our province. I met with Chief Mander recently to discuss some of the initiatives that we've undertaken over the last number of months and number of years. I hope the actions that we have taken have made a positive impact to those individuals throughout the province who find themselves addicted to prescription drugs. We have introduced a number of changes in models of care, for example, in addiction services, to ensure that Nova Scotians get access to programs and that they can have the support they need in the communities they live, and we're going to continue to move forward in trying to curb the incidents of prescription drug abuse here in the province.</p>

It is a multi-faceted problem that requires all hands on deck to deal with the issues of addictions and deaths related to opiates, sedatives, tranquilizers and stimulants.

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : I'm pleased to rise in my place today and speak for a few minutes on a bill that we presented around corporate welfare. As I meet with people up and down the Annapolis Valley, they are now talking about this as one of the areas that they didn't expect the NDP to invest in so heavily, both in terms of policy and in terms of money. This is an area now that many are calling one of the legacies of the NDP Government, a negative legacy, because what has happened is that these huge millions of dollars have not translated into the kind of jobs that Nova Scotians would obviously expect. There were six investments totalling $690 million alone. As we look over the course of the past year, there is a net minus of nearly 1,300 jobs in those industries.</p>

          <p>MS. PAM BIRDSALL : Mr. Speaker, I rise in my place to speak to Bill No. 1. We know that Nova Scotians want good jobs, high-paying jobs, jobs that have long-term investment in our community. Last Fall was one of the most significant periods in Nova Scotia job creation in recent memory. Nearly 1,000 new high-paying, long-term jobs were created by IBM Canada and PROJEX Technologies. If the Opposition had their way, those jobs would have gone elsewhere. Those companies could have chosen anywhere in the world to go, but they chose to come to Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : I'm pleased to take a few minutes to talk about what we think is a pretty important issue in this province and that is about the people living here, the people, certainly in the business community, who over the years have been struggling and we think about the title of this bill, Accountability in Economic Development Assistance Act. There have been many plans over the years, I guess, through multiple governments that have decided how money would be - I don't want to say passed out but - used to assist companies in staying afloat at times, companies that employ lots of people, which is important to us.</p>

That's the only way I can put it - they failed miserably. The population has shrunk in the province because our young people are going to Alberta to work, and they're soon going to be going to Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

          <p>MR. JIM BOUDREAU : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm very pleased to rise in my place today to debate this important issue. We all know the sordid history of the Liberal Party's trust fund. Back in the 1970s the Government of Gerald Regan forced any company wanting to do government business to donate a toll or money to the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia. The tainted donations poured in, making the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia one of the wealthiest political machines in Canada.</p>

          <p>The member for Annapolis, and current Liberal Leader, had his chance in 2009, when this NDP government brought in legislation saying that the money could not be used for partisan purposes. The current Liberal Leader, seeing that Nova Scotia finally had a government that would act decisively on this issue, publicly supported the legislation. I'll repeat that, Mr. Speaker : the Liberal Leader publicly supported this legislation, in fact voted for that legislation right here in this House.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Okay, so I have a question, and maybe the member for Yarmouth can answer it or maybe the member for Glace Bay. I'd like to be able to understand that. Is the money being used for research? Is that what their think-tank is going to do, research for the Liberal Party, or the federal Liberal Party, which transfers money to the provincial Liberals? Is it sort of an in-and-out thing? Does the research include the expensive polling that Gandalf is doing? These are legitimate questions to which nobody in the public knows the answers.</p>
