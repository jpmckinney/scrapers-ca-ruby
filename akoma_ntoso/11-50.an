          <p>HON. WILLIAM ESTABROOKS : Mr. Speaker, last week I was asked by the honourable member opposite how much the province paid per kilometre of chip seal since introducing a provincial chip-sealing crew this year.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : I want to thank the minister for the advance copy of his statement, Mr. Speaker. I don't know if I was the member opposite who he was referring to, but I think I am one of the ones who have asked questions regarding the cost of doing chip sealing by the government. Before I get to that particular question I had asked, which is not answered in here, I want to go back to a couple of other things that were stated inside of this statement that I think would help all of us and all Nova Scotians to fairly assess whether or not the province should be in the tendering business.</p>

          <from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I can hardly believe my ears today listening to the boasting of the government. The government's new chip-sealing crew only completed 10 per cent of the work that they were supposed to do. They only completed 40 kilometres out of the 366 that they had promised in the business plan they used to justify the government's entry into the paving and chip-sealing business. This underwhelming accomplishment cost taxpayers $1.4 million for equipment; that leaves only $600,000 for other costs. Will the government have us believe that all the materials used, the salaries for the 26 crew members, the accommodations, the training, the planning, and set-up costs at the department for this new venture by the government all came in at under $2 million?</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Since taking office the Premier has been raising taxes and fees while remaining silent on power, gas and food prices have been sky-rocketing. The Premier's failed approach has taken its toll on Nova Scotians who are struggling to keep up with their expenses, on businesses who are finding Nova Scotia is simply an uncompetitive environment to do business. It is also taking its toll on the job market. In the Premier's first month in power, employment was at 461,900 and today it is at 449,400.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Well, Mr. Speaker, this government is living in November of this year, not June, like those Nova Scotians who have lost their jobs under that government. In the past year 2,100 jobs have been lost in Cape Breton; 2,300 people have exited the workforce. In the North Shore region, 1,400 people have lost their jobs; another 1,400 people have just given up hope and left the workforce. In the Valley there are 600 fewer jobs and 1,800 people who have stopped looking, while in the southern region 2,500 people are out of work and another 4,300 have left the workforce and just given up hope of finding a job.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why the business community in this province now enjoys some of the lowest taxation rates in 20 years is because of the work that we have done in this province. The Leader of the Official Opposition is being completely disingenuous with the people of the province when he uses seasonally-adjusted numbers to try to justify their attack on the business community.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, seniors in Nova Scotia want to stay in their own homes as long as possible, an initiative known as Aging in Place that we all support, but sometimes it's simply not possible. The needs of many older Nova Scotians cannot be met without more advanced care, and often the most appropriate place for that advanced care is a long-term care facility.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows, it was this Party that championed the seniors and their right to be able to get into long-term care facilities without having to give up everything that they have worked their lives for in order to pay for medical care. That was this Party. It is this Party that opened, I think, seven new nursing homes in this province - long-term care facilities - in order to ensure that there were appropriate numbers of beds for those who are in need of those facilities.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, that's very interesting because the fact of the matter is that as soon as the Premier got into office, he cancelled 200 planned nursing home beds - 200 planned and promised nursing home beds that were supposed to service that very need. When he was in Opposition, the Premier said, why would a government rather see seniors go without service than admit they need more nursing home beds? The wait for long-term care beds is now longer than it was when the Premier made those statements before the last election and yet he decided to cancel the promise - the funded promise - of 200 more long-term care beds in our province. I will ask the Premier the same question today that he used to ask when he was on this side of the House, why would the Premier rather see seniors go without service than admit that there is a need for more long-term care beds?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we do no such thing. In fact we all know we have an aging population, we all know that there are growing requirements for models of care that are going to assist people right through the aging process. That means providing the appropriate number of long-term care beds, providing support so that people can stay in their own home, providing assisted living facilities and ensuring that those seniors get the kinds of facilities they need. That's going to be an ongoing process and it's one that this government has engaged in with communities right across the province.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, only with that Premier could meeting the needs of seniors long-term care needs mean cutting 200 promised long-term care beds, a promise that he told the people in the last election that he would uphold. We all know, and the statistics of his own Department of Finance confirm, that there is a growing need for long-term care beds. In fact, by the year 2036, according to the Department of Finance, there will be double the number of people over 85 years old as there are today. That is why there was a plan to build 1,320 more long-term care beds in this province, which in Opposition the Premier said he supported, but in government he cancelled the last 200 beds, flying in the face of the very statistics of his own department.</p>

Last year we opened an additional 475 new beds; we invested $21 million into the system last year. We recognize that with an aging population there is a growing demand for not only long-term care, but continuing care. Continuing care includes many seniors who want to remain in their own homes, close to their own families. We've invested in a Caregiver Benefit program. We've invested in a new program to provide snow removal and additional supports to seniors. Seniors are a priority for this government and they will continue to be a priority for this government.</p>

When somebody comes forward with a business case, I've said, and I will maintain, that we will look at that business case whether it be for a ferry, whether it be for a business, whether it be for anything.

When asked about Nova Scotia's plans for the CCSVI treatment last April, the Minister of Health and Wellness said, "We've said as a province we certainly will participate in clinical trials when the scientific panel recommends that clinical trials proceed."

Before Question Period today I was on the phone with our federal Minister of Health just finalizing our agenda items for Friday's agenda when all of the Health Ministers from across Canada will be here in Nova Scotia, along with our federal Health Minister. Indeed, we have a presentation from the Canadian Institute for Health Information with respect to what the guidelines will be with respect to clinical trials.

As we know, Nova Scotians are amongst the highest number of people with MS in the country. What we need to make sure is, and what I would ask the minister to do is, to take a real leadership role when she meets with her counterparts and push, not only her fellow Health Ministers, but also the federal minister to proceed quickly with the guidelines for these trials. Could the minister commit to that for this meeting?</p>

The Auditor General said on CBC's Information Morning last Thursday that, in terms of inspections for protecting public safety, it's simply not adequate. He said in a news conference that the department is not adequately managing its duty to audit - in other words, inspect - facilities that process meat or slaughter animals for human consumption and, "That failure increases public health risks associated with meat and meat products."</p>

They have become entities outside of government that this minister likes to hide behind. They have become her shield for cuts to budgets that in many districts across the province, despite the minister's denial, have impacted patient care and will continue to do so.

If this bill continues to work its way through the House at the expense of some other legislation that is needed, then I think we're going to be here for a while. I may have an opportunity again to rise in my place and talk about the role of government backbenchers and the role that they should be playing in looking after their constituents and not blindly following the front bench of this NDP Government, some of whom have been around a long time and who know the consequences of certain things and the repercussions they will have because of their involvement on both sides of the House in the past number of years.</p>

Anyway, members of this House should take a history lesson, and the Minister of Agriculture knows that he has heard me say this before, and I'm giving you ample warning of that, take a history lesson from the number of people that have gone through this House since 1993. They are not going to be re-elected here on Bill No. 102, I can guarantee you that, but they may get re-elected if they decide to let the Cabinet take the blame for this and make statements in this House as members, as MLAs. I refer again to the fact that you are not members of this government, you are MLAs on the government side. You're no different than the MLAs over here except you happen to sit on the government side.</p>

          <p>MR. MANNING MACDONALD : Listen to the member. Listen to that dreamer over there who used to be Speaker of this House until I chased him out of the Chair. His brilliance is that Mr. Chisholm will be the next Prime Minister of Canada, well let me tell you, if he is, heaven help Canada. But I'm going to tell you that former Leader of the Party, a CUPE representative, ended up on the transition team. As did Rick Clarke, as did other senior labour people in this province dictating policy to this government. I think this government should be representing all Nova Scotians, not vested interests like big labour in this province. Small business needs a government to represent them, small business in this province needs an advocate and that government can be an advocate for small business but not by bringing in bills like Bill No. 102. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker.</p>

We may not agree all the time but I particularly enjoyed his comments today. I've never seen anybody wind down seven times in the same speech before but if that's him in wind-down mode, look out when he's winding up. I could not agree more with pretty much 90 per cent of what he had to say, there may have been the occasional moment of disagreement but I do want to just recognize that a lot of common sense was just spoken in this House.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : It is tranquil. Exactly. The best word to use to describe our labour and management relations right now is very "tranquil." There is not a lot of labour disruption; it's very seldom that we've seen any troubles. I think we saw that there have only been three orders since 1998 to impose a collective agreement because of collective bargaining failing. If that's true - and that, in fact, was in the letter that the Coalition of Employers had brought forward as well, they had said, "We understand that since 1998, the Labour Board has only issued three orders to bargain. In fact, officials from your department report that in most cases agreements are negotiated amicably . . . ."</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Yes, I absolutely do. The middle ground is definitely the best ground. This is where you take the best ideas from both ideological ends of the spectrum. We find the Progressive Conservative Party very ideological. You can hear it again and again - and don't they speak often about the Fraser Institute and we know what the Minister of Finance thinks about the Fraser Institute. Then we have the other ideological side of the spectrum, we have the NDP who have their own think tanks and look at other viewpoints, but they are very labour-focused, there's no question about that.</p>

I guess I want to start off by saying it's not about unions, that's for sure. Quite a few years ago now, as I think about it, I was a member of a union and it was something that was introduced to us as paramedics - I can't remember the year, somewhere around 1990, 1992, something like that. It doesn't matter. There was a process that was in place that was fair.</p>

But we did speak to, Madam Speaker, we did organize ourselves, we got our own group together because we felt we needed to, there was no choice and I would argue, even today, that that is why we are, those fine ladies and gentlemen that are working in the streets today as paramedics are where they are. The good people working at communications are where they are. They are represented, they've had strong representation and I'm sure every employer - I know that my former employer wasn't the most excited when we signed union cards, he was mad. There is no question because he saw the end of the line for him. He saw we were going to break him, that we wanted to take everything he had. Well, believe me, Madam Speaker, there wasn't much to take, there wasn't much to take at all, but we felt that we could be treated a little better. We felt that we could at least be given a pair of boots and maybe a pair of pants, maybe an extra dollar an hour on our pay but that didn't come for an awful long time.</p>

ALLAN MACMASTER : Madam Speaker, this resolution has called upon the members of this House to require the Minister of Finance to take leadership on this important issue and find an immediate resolution to the Auditor General's concerns. Last week, as part of the Auditor General's Report, we learned that the Auditor General was prevented from doing his work, from their office doing their work, at the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board. More disturbing than that, we learned that the Minister of Finance wasn't going to do anything about it. It appears the Minister of Finance does not trust the Auditor General and if we look at what was said, and I can certainly table this, it comes from the Auditor General's most recent report dated November 2011, on Page 63, and it says in the department's response, ". . . the uncertainty revolves around whether your offices are authorized to exercise discretion in maintaining the confidentiality of certain operator information once in . . ." the Auditor General's hands.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Okay, I'm going to have to move ahead a little bit here. So I think, to wind down, we believe the Auditor General is correct and that the Minister of Finance should change his position on this matter. How can the minister stand with the Auditor General when he says things that he agrees with but stand against the Auditor General if something comes about, like this situation where the minister disagrees with the Auditor General.</p>

          <p>MR. HOWARD EPSTEIN : Thank you. This entire issue is a discussion for lawyers. We can have the discussion here, and to a certain extent we will, but really it should take place in the courts. The courts are the best place to resolve all of the issues that have been identified in this motion and have been identified in other discussions that have been associated with the issue.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Madam Speaker, it's quite an interesting topic and I appreciate the two previous speakers and their views on this. It's one that I've witnessed before when this government was in Opposition, actually, by the Finance Minister. I remember in one committee where I was Chairman, the Economic Development Committee, there was a big issue with whether the Deputy Minister of Finance should provide information to the committee. Indeed, we went through a long, protracted system to try to come up with a solution for that and, at the end of the day, we didn't get it. The now-Minister of Finance was very upset about that, and rightfully so. I was also very upset about it.</p>
