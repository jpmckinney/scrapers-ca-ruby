          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we learned from the Progressive Conservative Government of Newfoundland and Labrador that the costs associated with the Muskrat Falls project have changed dramatically. Projections for the cost of this project have gone up to $7.4 billion from $6.2 billion.</p>

The question before us is, what is the most cost-effective way to replace that generation? The answer to that is the Muskrat Falls project.</p>

They are a private company; the project is a private project; the capital invested will be private; and they will file the cost of the Maritime link between the Utility and Review Board. I'm surprised if the Leader of the Official Opposition in this province doesn't even understand how these projects are priced.</p>

We know that the Leader of the Official Opposition and the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia are proposing to deregulate the electricity market, increase the cost of power to consumers by 30 to 50 per cent - exactly what happened in the other jurisdictions. The Leader of the Official Opposition himself has said that he would allow people to come into the province and to set up natural gas electricity plants and compete head to head. Mr. Speaker, that's deregulation. He's trying to hide from it now but that's what he said.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it's so interesting, we have a Premier who wants to have a debate about Muskrat Falls but it's so obvious that he has already made up his mind and today we learn he has made up his mind regardless of the cost because, as we now know, the cost has gone from $6.2 billion up another $1.2 billion to $7.4 billion. We also know that Emera is going to make a 9.2 per cent guaranteed profit on their investment in Muskrat Falls.

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier is right about one thing - we should compare Muskrat Falls to all of the available options before us today. Newfoundland and Labrador has tied their anchor to it because they don't have options that Nova Scotia does, but the Premier has rigged the URB review to say they must approve Muskrat Falls and they must approve it only if it's consistent with his own electricity plans. The URB is not going to tell us how does it compare to natural gas, how does it compare to importing electricity from Quebec, how does it compare to all the other sources of energy we can bring into Nova Scotia?</p>

The Premier has told the URB they must approve his project - the project that he and Emera have together - if it meets his electricity plan which rules out counting natural gas as a renewable source.

The fact is that it may not meet the equivalency agreement now. The project, according to the Deputy Minister of Energy, is also behind schedule by at least a year. The government has put all its eggs in one basket - the Premier has all but admitted that today - and now we've also learned that Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec has not agreed to a division of water rights to allow the project to go ahead. I will table a letter by Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec denying the water right and the fact that it actually has the access, as well as a letter from lawyers in Newfoundland and Labrador agreeing to the fact that that is an issue.</p>

What we are doing is we have a project that is before us, a project which will mean that energy rates in this province, relative to the rest of the country, will actually decrease, will actually go down.

The fact is that the Premier has no backup plan for a project that has challenges and is now delayed. We also understand from Newfoundland and Labrador now that the federal loan guarantee is in question and that the reason why the loan guarantee may be in question is because the federal government is concerned about a World Trade Organization challenge under the provisions of subsidies and countervailing measures - and I'll table information on that - which is specifically whether the loan guarantee will be considered a subsidy on the cost of the export power.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday before the URB, Mr. Antonuk of Liberty Consulting said, a change in the relationship between Nova Scotia Power and the URB is not up to him or even the URB. He said it's up to the Legislature.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Certainly, the URB has a full responsibility to look at all the costs that are involved here and you mentioned the Liberty Group as being part of that. That's in the process, they're looking at expertise from all sources, so really it's the role of the URB to determine the fairest and just costs for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <from>MR. PORTER</from>
          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, one of the concerns raised by the Liberty audit is whether this relationship led to higher power bills than necessary. Muskrat Falls is the next biggest project that requires corporate separation between Nova Scotia Power and Emera. The cost of Muskrat Falls is continually going up, as we hear again today. Emera and this government signed a deal without even telling people how much they will have to pay. My question to the minister is, will the minister bring forward new legislation to protect ratepayers and provide corporate separation between Emera and Nova Scotia Power before any Muskrat Falls application goes before the URB?</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, certainly again the URB has the full and total responsibility to determine what is fair and what is just. If ratepayers have paid too much, the URB will have that responsibility to indicate that it should be paid back. If they've paid too little, then they'll have to deal with that as well but that's the full responsibility of the URB to determine, again, what is fair and just for ratepayers in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'll start again. The cost of Muskrat Falls is continuing to go up. As we heard today, the estimate has gone up by $1.2 billion and we know that can continue to rise. Emera gets a guaranteed profit when Nova Scotia Power builds big, expensive projects like Muskrat Falls and charges it back to ratepayers. Nova Scotians are right to worry about their interests and will they be protected. My question to the minister is, why is the minister continuing to stand with Emera, rather than ratepayers, when it comes to separating this corporate conflict?</p>

As my previous colleague just noted, at the Utility and Review Board hearing yesterday, the Liberty Consulting Group echoed the request that the Liberal caucus made to the board, which was that Emera and Nova Scotia Power Incorporated have firewalls put between them to prevent any real or potential conflicts of interest in the future.

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, the only people in this Legislature who seem to not understand how the Utility and Review Board works are the NDP. The question wasn't about whether the money should be refunded. I agree with the minister that the decision on whether that $10 million or $22 million gets refunded - or whatever number it ends up working out to be - is up to the board. The question which came up yesterday - which Liberty and the board both said was a policy question for this Legislature, not them - was whether there should be a firewall between Emera and Nova Scotia Power to prevent future conflicts of interest, and the question is simple. Does the minister agree with that?</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, again, the URB is a system that was set up under previous governments and it's a system that looks at all the costs, all the options, and determines what is fair and what is just. If they determine that Nova Scotia Power has charged too much, it will be paid back, and if it's not, it will not be. Being open and honest and transparent is important and the role of the board is to determine what's fair for Nova Scotians.</p>

This is not about the rate. This is about whether there should be a firewall between Nova Scotia Power and Emera. Liberty, in the direct comments - and he can go read the transcript himself - made it very clear, and the chairman of the board agreed yesterday, that it's a policy question.</p>

The tragic circumstances around Amanda Todd's death have put the issue of bullying and cyberbullying in the minds of parents and grandparents in Nova Scotia and all across Canada. Last Spring the Minister of Education assured parents that an anti-bullying coordinator would be put in place by September; and I'll table that document.</p>

          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, bullying in all of its forms, bullying, cyberbullying, is a very complex and a very heartbreaking situation that we are dealing with not only in Nova Scotia but across this country. We did name a coordinator, Kathleen Richard, to be our anti-bullying coordinator. She has hit the ground running. She's out in school boards. She's working with schools.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : The minister is quite correct that this is a very serious issue, serious enough that she had said herself the person should be in place in September, not after that. On April 27, 2012 the minister appeared on CBC's Information Morning to defend criticism from her own task force that her legislation did not go far enough. During that radio interview the minister said: The Justice Department and the anti-bullying coordinator will be working together and we're going to be liaising with stakeholders, police departments. So there's a lot of work that needs to be done because when we do put legislation forward, we want to make sure that we've considered all the potential implications for that legislation.</p>

Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, bullying and cyberbullying was the topic of the popular CBC Radio program Cross Country Checkup. Wayne MacKay, the chairman of the minister's Task Force on Cyberbullying was a guest on that show. As his interview concluded Professor MacKay said: to be fairly, brutally honest about this - break my heart might be a bit strong - but I am a bit disappointed that the governments have not reached more forceful and quickly, specifically, I guess, here in Nova Scotia. Professor MacKay said: Governments and others must move quickly to prevent tragedies due to bullying. My question to the minister is, when will the minister take the advice of her task force chairman, when will she finally move forcefully and quickly to protect kids in Nova Scotia?</p>

There are many causes for bullying and we need to get to the root causes. We are moving forward with our action plan. We're working collaboratively with many agencies, this is across government.

The Minister of Education's Task Force on Cyberbullying presented their final report in February of this year. This report was a comprehensive review of the state of cyberbullying in this province. The Minister of Education had the opportunity to take the 85 recommendations and create some meaningful legislation that would positively affect the lives of our young Nova Scotians.

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, quite simply, $60 million was handed over to DSME by this minister and the Premier. There were 500 jobs promised and the minister failed to deliver on that promise. We've taken a 49 per cent liability of the plant with little to no customers. With so much at stake in this deal, it's perplexing as to why the minister would push ahead so aggressively without a clear understanding of what he was getting himself into. Indeed, every single taxpayer in this province has gotten themselves into that through this minister and through the decisions made by Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. My question is, will the minister table his complete analysis of the markets and business case which led him to hand over $60 million to DSME with absolutely no job guarantees?</p>

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, earlier this year this government decided to move offices to other locations throughout the province, which seems like an okay idea except for the fact that it seems to have been mismanaged throughout the entire course of this. The Fisheries section of the department is being moved to Cornwallis but as revealed today in allnovascotia.com, the NDP Government is refusing to say how much they will be paying for rent in order to move this department to Cornwallis. My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is, why is the NDP Government refusing to release the cost of rent for the departmental move to Cornwallis?</p>

I really appreciate the opportunity to talk a bit about a move, about Fisheries and Aquaculture, because I can clearly point out that both parties had an opportunity over the last three decades - we've done more in the last three years regarding Fisheries and Aquaculture than the previous Parties have done since the golden time of sail.

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : We've said it's an okay idea to decentralize but this government hasn't even really done that. They've moved offices from Kentville to New Waterford and they said it was going to be cost neutral. I will table the comments from the Premier - he said it would be cost neutral - yet they don't tell us how much these things cost. This is an issue of accountability, openness, and transparency with the public. So I'll ask the minister again, what is the cost difference for the rent by moving this department to Cornwallis?</p>

What I will say is the cost of this particular building is roughly $250,000 a year but I would also add that we're combining other departments and we're saving $1.5 million from the Department of Natural Resources on our renovations. It's difficult for that member over there to understand but we're going to create jobs in rural Nova Scotia, which they should have done years ago. Thank you for the question.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Community Services. Today Food Banks Canada released their annual Hunger Count survey. It paints a very real picture of families in this province who have fallen on hard times. In the past year there were over 23,000 people assisted by food banks. Of those, more than one-third were children - 7,700 children had to rely on food banks for meals this past year. More than 3,000 new people have had to seek assistance from a food bank since the NDP formed government, and I will table that document.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, we realize how difficult it is for Nova Scotians, and we also realize that this is across Canada and throughout the world. To put this in perspective, we need to look also at the numbers in Alberta, which everybody sees as a prosperous province. Their food bank usage went up 60 per cent - 20 per cent more than Nova Scotia. The reason Nova Scotia has kept at that level is because this government, when we came in - we have in three years invested well over $300 million to break the cycle of poverty. We have developed and initiated numerous programs such as the Affordability Tax Credit and the Poverty Reduction Tax Credit. We increased the child tax benefit. What did the Progressive Conservatives ever do? Absolutely nothing.</p>

Let's take a look at some of the costs of people who are living on a low income, who it affects even more - costs like power bills. They've gone up by more than 40 per cent due to this government's energy policy.</p>

The Preston riding is very unique in the province and for over 200 years, the community has tried to get electoral representation. Luckily in 1993, that did happen, with the election of the Honourable Wayne Adams, the first Black Nova Scotian ever elected to the Nova Scotia Legislature and indeed, the first Black Cabinet Minister ever in the Province of Nova Scotia. His picture hangs over here in the Chamber and it's quite a privilege to sit in sort of his shadow as we move forward.

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate an important choice that is facing the province. It is a choice that will forever change the cost that tomorrow's families will pay to get reliable and affordable energy. It's a choice that previous governments ignored and as a result, families today are struggling to pay the high and unpredictable cost of energy. Because of previous governments' inactions, families are struggling, the environment is suffering and the province is at the mercy of expensive imported coal.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I was amused by the Premier's presentation here tonight, talking about my trip to Newfoundland and Labrador. I must confess I was impressed with the former Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador - Mr. Williams. I want to tell you I did take the commercial flight. I didn't ask Chris Huskilson to fly me over, nor did I ask Chris Huskilson to participate in writing the speech that has been presented here by the Government of Nova Scotia. It's pretty interesting, the Premier has forgotten what is his responsibility, which is to stand up and protect ratepayers, not to stand up and defend Nova Scotia Power or Emera. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Well, the Premier asked, that's great. I'm glad the Premier asked, Mr. Speaker. What any reasonable government would do, would look at all possible options presented to them instead of attaching themselves to a deal that is to the benefit of Newfoundland and Labrador. You can't tell Nova Scotians the cost of this project. You had a chance. You did not once say how much it was going to cost. You did not once say. If you want to get up and tell Nova Scotians how much a kilowatt of energy is going to cost, then do so. You can't. You know you can't. You've attached yourself to a project that you can't tell people how much it will cost and you know it. (Applause) That's not leadership. That is not leadership. That is looking after the shareholders of Emera and not the ratepayers of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : So why are you legislating it? Why is he legislating it? The Premier says they do but he's legislating it, so why is he doing that - because they don't have the authority. (Interruptions) Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is there are other options. Never once did anyone in this caucus, or me as the Leader, talk about deregulation. As a matter of fact we talked about allowing competition in a highly regulated environment and if the Premier has paid attention, he would have known that. The Province of New Brunswick actually does that now.</p>

This is a very serious topic and a very complex one but I can't help but say, just to start off, that I am quite amused by the two speeches that I've just heard preceding me. First, we had the Premier who gave his remarks. I happen to know, Mr. Speaker, having heard them before and having that feeling of d&#xE9;j&#xE0; vu, that if you lined up the Premier's remarks with the remarks of the CEO of Emera on the exact same topic, they would be an exact match, they make the exact same point.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, there have been some interesting tales told by the NDP and the Third Party over the past little while - interesting tales indeed. In fact, the Energy Minister just tabled the statement referring to the bill which the Leader of the Official Opposition has said all along outlines breaking the monopoly piece, which is exactly what the Deputy Premier has said, in almost the exact same words that the Deputy Premier used. It is nice to have the Deputy Premier's endorsement as well as the endorsement of the member for Halifax Chebucto, who has also used almost exactly the same words as the Leader of the Official Opposition has used. We thank the Minister of Energy for pointing out that the bill has been tabled before this House for more than three years now. Maybe he'll let the Premier know, because the Premier seemed to be having trouble realizing that that is actually there.</p>
