        <p>MR. SPEAKER : Order, please. Before we start the daily routine, I just want to remind all members that Richard (Buzz) Gero, who has been employed in multiple positions during numerous sessions, most recently as a parking lot attendant over the last few years, has been the site supervisor's go-to guy when the Province House Commissionaires require temporary and short replacements for all of the various duties performed by his staff.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday this government opened the main forest roads on the former Bowater Mersey lands. (Applause) These are lands that the province purchased last year, following Bowater's announcement that it was closing the mill in Liverpool. As Crown lands, they belong to all Nova Scotians, and yesterday we opened about 1,700 kilometres of roads on those lands.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for the advance copy of her statement. We certainly support the opening of those roads to ATVs in the former Bowater lands, and it's interesting because opening the roads will allow that access, it'll allow better access for hunters, better access for people in the winter with snowmobiles - I assume this covers snowmobiles and so forth.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I also thank the minister for the advance copy of the speech. Access, of course, is extremely important for sportspeople, enthusiasts, those kinds of folks. When it comes to the Bowater lands, of course the Bowater lands are a part of my constituency of Argyle and it flows all the way up to the minister's constituency along that South Shore.</p>

          <from>HON. JOHN MACDONELL</from>
          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, last year, almost exactly one year ago today, this government introduced amendments to the Consumer Protection Act to protect Nova Scotians when they enter into cellphone contracts. I stand here today to remind members of this House, and all Nova Scotians, that as of tomorrow, May 1st, we will have access to clearer, fairer, cellphone contracts in this province. (Applause)</p>

          <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for advance notice of the statement. The changes to the Consumer Protection Act took place last Spring in Bill No. 65 on April 27, 2012. The bill speaks to contracts and fees for cellphones. The statement the minister indicated today said there are clear formulas for calculating the cancellation of the fees. Unfortunately, he did not provide that today but he did indicate that it would be a $50 maximum fee for cancelling a cellphone, so it's two separate items that are in this statement.</p>

          <from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I was recently speaking with a friend of mine who visited India and he was telling me that the cost to use a cellphone in India right now is $2 a month, which is quite amazing. No doubt, because of the volume of people over the area of geography that it covers, there's certainly economies of scale in India. I think that consumer protection is something that is important when we think about cellphones and smart phones, of course just about everybody has one today and it consumes a tremendous amount of the monthly budget for most people as well, especially if you have more than one in your household. I know parents now with children who have them, in some cases they might be paying four phone bills in a month.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, their information is based on actually reaching out and talking to small-business owners - something this government hasn't done for four years. Additionally, businesses are reporting that their hiring intentions are going soft; the Conference Board of Canada is reporting a tightening of the labour market; and the CFIB shows hiring intentions are dropping.</p>

The labour force will grow as well, so the unemployment rate will grow, but the number of people working will increase and they will be working at higher wages - that is good for the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I don't know what planet the Premier is on because it has been very well recorded that in the last year Nova Scotia had flatline economic growth, a grand total under his leadership of 0.2 per cent. Now we see that Nova Scotia's small businesses are reporting that they have the lowest business confidence of any province in all of Canada, and I will quote from the CFIB, "Nova Scotia has had the biggest dive in business optimism of any province . . ." - and I will table that.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I think I'll stick to the words of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business itself who say their business barometer now stands at 53.8, the lowest in all of the country; that is what they are saying. So what is so unique about Nova Scotia that we have the lowest confidence among small business in the whole country? We have the highest power rates, the highest taxes. We have record out-migration, a huge new burden of regulation under this government.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the simple fact of the matter is that business taxes in this province are the lowest they have been in more than 20 years. They are lower than the entire 10 years when the Progressive Conservatives were in power. They are lower than when the Liberal Party was in power. The small business rate has gone down, the large corporation capital tax has gone down, and if the Leader would actually read what he tabled, it says, "Hiring intentions, while initially quite promising early in the year, have softened somewhat, although they remain better than the past 2011 and 2012 levels." I will now ask this be properly tabled.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, when small businesses are asked what their major cost constraint was, business owners across the province indicated fuel and energy costs were their biggest concerns. This should come as no surprise. Businesses have listed energy as their number one concern for at least as long as the NDP Government has been in power. My question to the Premier is, why has the Premier left the energy future in the hands of Nova Scotia Power?</p>

It was the very first thing that we did in government, the very first thing.

What I said was that the Premier should do his job and not let the president of Nova Scotia Power dig deeper into the pockets of every Nova Scotian. What I said is the Premier should look Nova Scotians in the eye and actually tell them the truth, what he's going to do, instead when he's campaigning telling them he's going to take a tax off when in actual fact he added a tax to every power bill in the Province of Nova Scotia. It's called the NDP electricity tax.</p>

He wants to turn it over to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, one of the largest monopolies in the world.

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy. This is a government which would rather put Nova Scotia's energy future in the hands of the Newfoundland and Labrador Government and Nova Scotia Power rather than the made-in-Nova Scotia options that most of the experts now say would be cheaper than the Maritime Link. On April 25th, The Consumer Advocate sent a letter to the Minister of Energy in response to his comments here in Question Period and also to the media, in which he said that, "Your assumption the timeframe provides adequate time is not correct."</p>

We're diversifying, getting away from coal, which has been the base of our energy for far, far too long. Coal has gone up in price for the last seven or eight years, and now we're diversifying into wind, tidal, sustainable biomass, natural gas, and heritage hydro. The Maritime Link is an important part of that mix. It will allow us to look at more renewables and more sources of energy from other jurisdictions. I think the URB process is unfolding as it should, and we'll await the decision by the end of July.</p>

We never heard from the Liberal Party at all, but we certainly did hear from The Consumer Advocate. Department of Energy staff sat down with him, and he had some useful information to pass along to us about the scope of the project. We listened, and we continue to listen to Nova Scotians.

Recently we have had the hiring of a new person to oversee Film Nova Scotia and there has been some expansion of their mandate with respect to the creative industries and a new CEO has been hired and in the fullness of time, Mr. Speaker, there will be the work that I made reference to in the Fall. It is still our intention to proceed with a review. It will be a robust review that will involve the industry to gather of all of their perspectives. Some of those perspectives I've already heard, as I meet with people individually, and we will continue to work with that industry to ensure that they are stable and prosperous in our province.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, the tax credit is important, and it is a powerful tool to our economy, but it is disappointing that these problems are persisting with the processing of the applications. The minister has had ample time since I first brought this to her attention and now we have another example of procedural duplication and frustratingly low processing times. I will table a letter that was sent to the minister on April 1st of this year and the accompanying e-mail as well as the correspondence that I tabled with the issue that was raised last November.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to the honourable member, the film industry is very important, the tax credit is very important. There is some reorganization going on at the level of the Film and Creative Industries council. There is a working group within government that are starting to define the parameters of a review and a consultation, and as I indicated, that consultation can only take place with the full involvement of those in the industry who know it best, and that certainly will occur.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, what we're talking about today around the Film Tax Credit really amounts to red tape, to slow processes, to an inability to respond to business. The film industry in our province is worth millions of dollars and the producers of these films are putting hundreds of thousands, and sometime millions, of dollars on the table to do productions in our province, and if we can't process those applications in a timely fashion people will go elsewhere. The letters I tabled today speak to that, they speak to a specific incident and a film where that is an issue and the filmmakers will leave - that's what I want to raise with the minister today.</p>

We are breaking down the silos between these departments so that we can have the best response possible to the industry. As I said, we have already identified some of the impediments for the processing of these tax credits, and we are diligently working to remove them.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, nurses in this province say staffing rules for nursing homes and residential care facilities are dangerously out of date.

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I had the honour, with the Premier, today, to actually meet with and address the nurses in Truro at their AGM. We were well received, and I have to say there was a lot of discussion between the nurses, the union, and the Premier and I. We are going to move forward as we continue to do, as we've done in the last four years, with partners. Our partners are the unions in this province, and they are the nurses in this province. We are going to continue to work to ensure that the staffing levels meet the guidelines that are set out across the country to ensure that patients receive the adequate care they need, and that's the approach we've taken over the last four years.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, there are more than 2,400 seniors waiting to be placed in a long-term care facilities today. Janet Hazleton told reporters that "We can have all kinds of beds open, but if we don't have the nurses to look after the residents then what's the point?" Learning that there are vacancies but not enough nurses is cold comfort to those 2,400 seniors waiting for placement. My question to the minister is, how many bed vacancies have been left unfilled because the government has failed to address the "dangerously out-of-date staff rules for nurses?"</p>

          <from>MR. WILSON</from>
          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, that is just simply not true, what the member opposite is talking about. Back in 2011 we did a staffing review to see what levels were sufficient in long-term care facilities. Last year alone we increased the budget by over $2 million, which increased over 34 positions across facilities in Nova Scotia. It is one thing that we are proud about doing, ensuring that we work with our partners, with the unions, those who represent the important work that nurses do in the province. I think our track record is indicated much better than the track record of what the former government has had - we're working with them to solve issues in health care, not working against them.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, the seniors have worked long and hard and contributed to our economy and to our province their whole lives. They deserve to be treated with the utmost respect. This government needs to get their ducks in a row when it comes to addressing the needs of seniors.

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I believe that actions speak louder than words and the actions that we have taken over the last four years, to support seniors in this province, talk for themselves. Seniors know that we reduced taxes that they pay in this province. More low-income Nova Scotians, senior Nova Scotians, pay no income tax here in this province. Under the Progressive Conservatives, they felt it was okay to charge seniors income tax. Under the NDP Government we respect the commitment that seniors have had to build this economy. That is why we ensure that the loved ones who are left in the communities have more money in their pockets to remain in their homes. We reduced the requirements for seniors to pay in a long-term care facility.</p>

LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the delivery of health care in a timely manner requires planning, it requires the development of targets, it requires a plan to meet the targets and it requires monitoring. It also requires accountability to the people of Nova Scotia for results. Since 2004 Nova Scotia has been the beneficiary of over $159 million from the federal government in the form of the Wait Times Reduction Fund, a fund established to augment provincial efforts in addressing wait-times in our health care system.</p>

During estimates I asked the Minister of Health and Wellness to table a list, one simple list of what they spent the Wait Times Reduction Fund on in 2012-13 and what they plan to spend the money on this fiscal year.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, provinces across the country - Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Ontario, and Newfoundland and Labrador - have all established wait time reduction plans. They set targets for themselves, and they went about achieving them using the wait time reduction fund to augment their plans. It would appear that this NDP Government saw fit to dump the money into general revenue. Whether the fund was used to balance the budget or to bail out Bowater, it would appear the money was not used for what it was intended.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I don't even know where to start with that question. We work hard here in the province to ensure that we provide health care services for Nova Scotians. When the federal health transfer started, it was supposed to be a 50-50 cost-sharing venture for the provinces and territories. I believe we're just over 20 per cent now here in the province, and the federal government is backing away from the Health Accord, which puts more pressure on all the jurisdictions across the country under all political Parties.</p>

We know, and I've said this many, many times in the House, government, whoever is in government in the future, is always going to be in the business of providing long-term care. They're going to need to replace them; they're going to need to build new ones. We're committed to that, and any future government has to be committed to that.

We know the demographic shift in the coming years, where we're going to have more seniors living not only in our province, but across the country.

          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : I'm pleased to stand and speak on Bill No. 66. It touches a place with me, that's for sure. Yesterday the government introduced the bill to honour the work and sacrifice of Nova Scotians who make their living at sea. My family has been at the fishing industry in this province for 15 generations if my children go, and I believe they will. That will make - I'm 13th generation, my sons are 14th and my grandchildren are 15th. When my forefather came here in 1637, he fished these coastal waters with the Mi'kmaq Indians to make a living, and that's where we started. It's a very fitting tribute to the coastal communities of this province and I thank the minister for bringing this forward because I believe that it would be very fitting - a great tribute to the coastal communities that helped build this province.</p>

          <p>MS. BECKY KENT : Mr. Speaker, I'm particularly pleased today to rise in support of this Bill No. 66, the Mariners' Day Act. I'm going to reflect a little bit on all the reasons why but I want to start with saying how proud I am to be part of a government, but more importantly, to have a colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, who not only is doing such a great job but is also a fisherman in his own right, and to bring this bill forward at this point - I'm very proud of that and I think we should acknowledge that.</p>

I think, simply put, in hearing some of the earlier speeches, especially the member for Digby-Annapolis talk of 15 generations, I think a bill like this is probably easily said to be long overdue, so I want to congratulate the minister. Unfortunately it comes after such a tragedy of Miss Ally but I think if we look back and we recount all the stories and the proud history of the fishing industry of Nova Scotia, it is definitely one that is long overdue.</p>

Fishermen are noted for truths and untruths so we just have to make sure the truth is being told, but it has been very interesting to sit back. But you know it doesn't matter where you live, the fishery plays an important role in the lives of every Nova Scotian. I just want to talk very briefly that the members of the fishing communities in Nova Scotia are like family. I know that in communities like Bay St. Lawrence, St. Margaret Village, Cape North, Dingwall, Neils Harbour, Ingonish, Little River, Englishtown, Big Bras d'Or, Point Aconi, all the people who make a living on the sea are concerned for each other as well.

Our province has about 13,000 kilometres of seacoast; there are very few members here in the Chamber who don't have some fishing communities. I know in the riding that I represent there are still two fishing communities, the community of Harbourville and the community of Canada Creek. One of the very prominent communities used to be Morden, which was once the eighth-largest port in Nova Scotia, in terms of volume of trade - fishing, lumber, and agricultural produce moving through.</p>

One of the things I've noticed today is since I've been in the Legislature, which hasn't been very long, since 2009, this has been the bill on which the most people have spoken - as least I think it's the record since I've been here, and I think that says something about the power of the particular bill and how members feel about it.</p>
