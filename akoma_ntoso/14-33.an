          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Gas prices are likely to hit an all-time high later this week. As all Nova Scotians are painfully aware, 25.5 cents of every litre that they buy goes to taxes to the government, plus, on top of that, they pay another 15 per cent HST. That is an immoral tax on tax that must stop.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party for the question. This has been an issue not only for this province but indeed across the country. As he would know, the actual base price is set; gold markets. The thing that the province can deal with obviously is taxation.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the price of gasoline goes up and up and the tax on tax goes right up with it. It is a double-dipping by the government into the wallets of every Nova Scotian, at a time when they can't afford to pay more.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to tell members of this House the fact that I very much enjoy continuing to build a positive relationship with Ottawa through Minister MacKay. We've talked about a whole host of issues. The Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party may not be aware that in May I'll be meeting with the Atlantic Premiers. As he knows, the HST is in a number of our provinces, requires a number of Premiers to actually look for the opening up of the HST agreement. It will be one of the parts of the conversations that I have with the Atlantic Premiers.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'll take that answer to be "no", after six month in office on such an immoral tax. I'll just to say to the Premier, if he wants to build a positive relationship with the people of Nova Scotia, he should actually stand up for them and do what he said he would do during the election and get rid of that tax on tax on gasoline because it's wrong and it is immoral.</p>

Not that anyone should take consolation in that, we're going to continue to do what I said, which is to begin to ensure that we work with our neighbouring provinces to look at ensuring we can decouple the HST from charging it off the motive fuel tax.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Another way to help Nova Scotians with the sky-high price of gasoline is to get to work on the west-east pipeline which all Canadians now see as a way to get Alberta oil unrefined to Atlantic markets and beyond across to Europe. In fact, that very pipeline is before the National Energy Board today starting the regulatory approval process. We know when we read the local newspapers that the Premier of New Brunswick is working very hard to make sure that pipeline gets to Saint John, New Brunswick, which will benefit all New Brunswickers. But we have seen no action from the Premier of Nova Scotia to try to extend it here to our province, despite the strong business case to do so and the benefits it would bring to Nova Scotia.</p>

This is about doing what's right for Nova Scotia, and that's what this government is doing. (Applause)</p>

          <from>MR. LARRY HARRISON</from>
          <p>MR. LARRY HARRISON : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask a question of the Minister of Environment regarding the environmental assessment process. Earlier today I submitted a petition from residents of Colchester County who are concerned about wind turbines, and these are wind turbines that have already been approved for the Greenfield area. The petition is signed by those who will be living in the vicinity of this project, which received approval from the minister earlier this year.</p>

          <p>HON. RANDY DELOREY : Mr. Speaker, I guess a couple of things, just to clarify. The petition that was put forward at the start of the session today was actually directed toward the Minister of Energy and related to the COMFIT process, which falls outside of my purview of responsibility.</p>

          <p>MR. HARRISON : I've been involved with this for a number of months now and my concern was then, and still is, the level of consultation that this project has had with the community. Their concerns include potential effects that this project may have on wildlife and nearby residents.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, again my question through you is to the Premier. Yesterday, with the announcement of the Invest Nova Scotia Board, Nova Scotians learned of yet another broken Liberal promise. Prior to the election, the Premier advertised that his government would turn away companies looking for assistance and send them to a bank. A Liberal Government would be the lender of last resort, the Premier said.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the honourable member and all Nova Scotians that any decision made when it comes to lending money in this province will be put through a business lens. It will be arm's length from Cabinet. I want to assure all Nova Scotians that the way money had been thrown around by the previous government has stopped.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, Invest Nova Scotia is a far cry from what the current Premier called for. At the time, in 2010 for example, and I'll table, the Leader of the Opposition said, "Politics has no place in the loan business," and that all government investments would be controlled by Nova Scotia Business Inc. I'll table that.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I want to remind and assure the honourable member that not only have we taken the politics out of lending in this province, we've actually put it in the hands of business people. Recently, we announced an increase to small business with the credit union, Mr. Speaker, which means the province will cover 90 per cent of that lending. It was a program that had been put in place for some period of time. It had huge success. It was actually the credit union that was actually reviewing the business plans, making sure that it was being done on sound business principles.</p>

They're a fine institution, as the Leader of the Official Opposition could attest to. We all love the credit union. But really, I'm not sure what that has to do with the political control that exists in that Cabinet over the Invest Nova Scotia fund.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage about the Lunenburg member's involvement in the Bluenose II restoration file. Before the minister could respond, the Premier was on his feet dancing around the question and relying on empty, angry rhetoric. Nova Scotians were still left with unanswered questions.</p>

          <p>MS. MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious issue for South Shore residents and businesses. The economy of the region has already been crippled at the hands of the previous government, and the Liberals. By refusing to answer questions about the Bluenose II it is leaving everyone in limbo. At a time when Nova Scotians are seeking leadership the Premier resorted to empty, angry rhetoric. Will the Premier apologize to the tourism operators and taxpayers for his angry outburst and give them the answers they deserve?</p>

          <p>MS. MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier's angry outburst yesterday suggests one of two things must be true. Either the Liberals have completely lost control of the Bluenose II file, or they intentionally are keeping Nova Scotians in the dark. Either way, Nova Scotians are tired of the political gamesmanship and empty, angry rhetoric from the Premier and his government.</p>

I want to remind all members of this House, the member for Lunenburg has always stood up and been forthright not only with her constituents and the people of this province.

The position the minister just took doesn't seem to square with the actions of the member for Antigonish prior to last Fall's election. The now-Minister of Environment has stated publicly that he has very little faith in school boards' abilities to make these kinds of decisions. In fact, an organization he represented took the Strait Regional School Board to court when they were going through their school review process.</p>

First of all, during the last election that was held only six months ago, the Liberal Party was very honest in its approach in saying exactly what we could not afford.

I realize there are ongoing initiatives with the government to try to address this awful disease, but more needs to be done.</p>

We now have six areas that are identified as the hot spots where the blacklegged tick habitat has a greater concentration and, therefore, the possibilities of contracting Lyme disease.</p>

          <p>HON. PAT DUNN : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. Yesterday the minister unveiled another model for closing schools. It seems, however, that the new process will be cold comfort to parents and students in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board whose schools are on the chopping block.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : It's true that we did introduce Bill No. 63 yesterday. The bill was designed to put in place a new process that will allow communities, school boards, municipalities, parents, school advisory councils, to come together, to trust one another, and to work through a process that will allow school boards to do what is their responsibility and that is to review schools and, if necessary, close schools.</p>

          <p>MR. DUNN : Mr. Speaker, there is no argument that the school review process was broken and that's why a new process was developed. However, it's not fair that parents, students, and teachers in one region are being forced to live by decisions made in a broken process. My question to the minister is, will the minister immediately direct the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board to stop moving forward with the former broken system?</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : I stated yesterday, and I will state publicly again today, that this bill is not to reverse decisions that were made by previous boards or under a previous government, but it is a go-forward bill that will allow the schools and the communities to come together in hopefully what will be a trusting relationship that allows the best interest of kids to be part of the decision that's made.</p>

          <p>MR. DUNN : Mr. Speaker, there is a precedent, as the minister knows well, for a Minister of Education to step in when a school board isn't meeting expectations, and I realize that under normal conditions you would let the process go through. However, it just seems that with the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board that they're not willing to use this new process which I think would be a very fair process. Now is the time to provide parents, students, and teachers at those three schools with the opportunity of a fair chance using this new process.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, it is good to know that there are things that are happening. The report stated that young people between 18 and 24 were accused of firearm-related crime at a higher rate than any other group. I think of mainly young men who are carrying guns and it's startling the violence that our young people are exposed to - it's glamorized in movies and video games.</p>

          <p>MS. DIAB : Mr. Speaker, we've worked very hard to bring Ceasefire to the Halifax area. If we want to reduce gun violence, or any violence, we need to work together as a community. This particular program is one that is community led and that is the very significant feature that this Ceasefire has. I was at the announcement and I saw the many men that you're talking about, and they were so pleased and I actually saw some tears in some mother's, grandmother's and young men's eyes when that announcement was made. We look very forward to seeing it roll out across Halifax and seeing a lot of good things come out of it.</p>

I'm still attempting to get some answers regarding the recent DCS announcement that there will be a review of discretionary funding for non-profit organizations. Since the early 2000s, Mr. Speaker - and I think the minister is probably aware - there have been two previous governments that have reviewed the grants and contributions. Yet we know there will be yet another review.</p>

Complex financial tools such as derivatives are not designed for all investors, and therefore should be regulated to ensure that advisers and clients are protected from the leverage that these financial tools utilize. When utilizing securities that are characterized as highly leveraged, the upside and the downside are significant. An investor can make a significant gain or take a significant loss.</p>

          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, unfortunately this is a bill that we cannot support. Governing is about making tough decisions. It's about establishing priorities for the people of Nova Scotia. We hear lots of talk from the government side about how the government can't afford to do this or can't afford to do that because of the revenue situation. It's just disappointing to people on this side and disappointing to many Nova Scotians that the government tabled a budget that showed spending increases in the range of $400 million but yet they couldn't cut the taxes and give Nova Scotians a break, as was anticipated. So we could have reined in the spending a little bit and let Nova Scotians get the break on taxes that they deserve. That's what we feel should have been done.</p>

Here is the thing I would like the minister to consider in this bill: first and foremost there should be some kind of a regulation that the amount of distance the child has to travel to get to the school, especially elementary, be part of the decision-making. They need to be able to look at that.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise to my feet today to speak to Bill No. 65, amending the Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition Commission Act. I rise in support of this bill today - I'm sure some of the members across the way might be surprised, but yes, we do support bills that we believe in. The minister and I have talked at great length about this particular bill and about what's going on in Truro-Bible Hill.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for those words of support on this very important issue. I know when I was first approached by the Premier to take this over, I thought to myself, oh no, what am I getting into? I'm pleased that I was given that responsibility. I remember from being in this House for a long time it has always been an issue of the raceway, and the issue has always been around accountability. That changed the day I took it over and I appreciate the support from both Parties in this regard.</p>

These amendments were requested by Halifax Regional Municipality and we are pleased to bring them forward to ensure the charter contains the consistency and clarity HRM is seeking.
