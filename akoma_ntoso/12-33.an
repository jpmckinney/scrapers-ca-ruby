The venue for the Premier to do that would be the URB - to show up and let everyone know that he would be opposed to the rate increase in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

We did that when we provided more than $11 million worth of relief to people through the Heating Assistance Rebate Program.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, my question is for the Premier. All Nova Scotians were shocked and angered when Nova Scotia Power planned to raise their power rates by 6 per cent over two years. That is an increase beyond the ability of Nova Scotians to pay and will cost Nova Scotians further job losses. My question is, when did the Premier or anyone in his government - including staff - learn that Nova Scotia Power was planning such an increase?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, what I can say is this. The Government of Nova Scotia was left with a utility that was privatized. It was privatized by the Progressive Conservatives and when they did that, I want to remind Nova Scotians that a former president of the Progressive Conservative Party was made the president of Nova Scotia Power. He was examined, at the time, before the Public Accounts Committee, and I want to read just a short passage about the privatization efforts that the Progressive Conservatives made at the time.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, the reason why we have a privatized utility is because the members of the Progressive Conservative Party decided that on the basis of philosophy. They didn't need any studies. They didn't need to talk to anybody about it. They didn't need to see whether or not the people of Nova Scotia would benefit. If there is one thing that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party can do the next time he stands up, it is to apologize to the people of Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, the problem is not the separation of the power company from the government 20 years ago, the problem is the cozy relationship. The fact that that Premier is in bed with Nova Scotia Power today, that is the problem with our power rates. To point back 20 years or more, shows how cozy that relationship today is. That is the problem that Nova Scotians have today. They are so close that now we know they are even commuting to work together on the corporate jet. That is what is offensive to Nova Scotians. That is what they deserve an apology for, not something that happened in the 1990's.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Today government revealed its much-anticipated Mental Health and Addictions Strategy. Two years in the making, today's unveiling told us nothing new that wasn't already known and should have been implemented two years ago. While the strategy identifies the importance of early intervention, Madam Speaker - there is no question early intervention is important - there is no mention made as to how government will address gaps to support geriatric mental health programs, no mention of support for university students, no mention for any programs to support women in domestic violence situations and the impact this has on their overall mental health. So my question to the Premier is, can the Premier please explain why the strategy failed to address these gaps?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, as we all know, a strategy is not worth the paper it is written on unless resources are in place to fully implement it. While the Premier and this government brought forward a budget that ensured the administration of the Department of Health and Wellness grew by 3.8 per cent, the funding committed to mental health and addictions-based funding grew by 3 per cent.</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : The simple fact of the matter is that we have cut the costs of administration in Health and Wellness significantly. When we came to power the administrative costs associated with the health care system ran not only higher than the national average but among the highest in the country; it is now below the national average. The money committed to the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy is the single largest commitment to mental health in our province's history.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, regardless, if the Premier would read his own budget he would see an increase in administration in the Department of Health and Wellness. There is not a professional in the mental health system, there is not a family desperately waiting for mental health assessments and there's not a family physician in this province who doesn't get frustrated with the wait times associated with assessments. The key, however, is ensuring that the programs are available to treat the diagnosis after the diagnosis has been made. My final question to the Premier is, why does the strategy focus only on assessment wait times while failing to address the very necessary treatment wait times?</p>

There are 50 collective agreements up this year in our health sector, starting with 6,500 nurses who begin collective bargaining in just a few weeks. The president of the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union has already said that we're likely headed for a strike, and I will table that for the benefit of the House.

I would remind the House that this is the Party that introduced legislation that would create chaos in the health care bargaining sector. (Interruptions) That was just now, that was in this session that they introduced legislation which would essentially create chaos. I want to share with the members opposite, this is an editorial from The ChronicleHerald on September 14, 2007, and this is what it says: "But the evidence shows that in jurisdictions where binding arbitration is mandatory, or where health-care workers are subject to essential services legislation, frustrations eventually mount and illegal strikes become more frequent and nasty. Patient safety is in far greater jeopardy then."</p>

In other health authorities such as the Cape Breton District Health Authority there is no such protection for patients in the event of a work stoppage. I will quote recently from the just-retired CEO of Capital Health, Mr. John Malcom who says that ". . . Capital Health has a provision in the agreement with the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union to provide essential services." Cape Breton District Health Authority has no such provision, and I will table that for the benefit of the House.</p>

We're not going to do what the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party would do, which is implement mandatory - let me stress that: mandatory - arbitration that would lead to health care chaos and that would only bring in the illegal strikes that would cause massive disruption in our system. That would be a mistake.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, the strategy announced today will see every child 18 months of age screened to pick up any delays and any problems and to do early identification. It will see clinicians added into the SchoolsPlus system across this province. It will add additional services throughout the province for addictions programs where they are sorely needed. It will see the support line for families that has been so effective in Cape Breton and in metro Halifax extended to the entire province. What this strategy does is divert people from the hospital system and provides the community-based services in communities where they should have been provided 20 years ago or 15 years ago, when that Party was in power and they cut the guts out of the mental health system in Nova Scotia.

While it wasn't damaging enough for the program to see the loss of valuable team members when youth mental health workers were fired, access to a psychiatrist for the ACT program has also been recently reduced. The full-time ACT program psychiatrist has been reduced to a 0.5 position and, to make matters worse, this same psychiatrist is filling a 0.5 position in the Young Tower program while holding down a full-time position at 4 South.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Madam Speaker, the minister knows that there weren't 700 or 800 for the ACT program. The minister has spoken in the past of the importance of family reintegration, and I agree, it is important. However, the ACT program as it previously existed did just that. When a patient was admitted, parents were invited on the unit to interact with their children on weekend one, weekend two they were given a day pass, weekend three they were given a weekend pass to go home and so on. Now, in order to save money and pay for faster assessments, staff shuts down the program Friday at 3:00 p.m. and tells everyone to go home.</p>

The new model that they have adopted is a model that will ensure that there are timely assessments, timely treatment with the right clinicians, better care sooner for families and children, and this is the approach that we, in this government support.

There have been patients of the ACT program who have ended up in emergency rooms just like I said to the minister as to what would happen. She should really speak to the IWK ACT program staff; the most tragic statistic of all, children are returning to the program on Monday morning who have regressed to the point where program staff, whom I met with, spent two days getting patients to the same condition they were in when they were released the previous Friday. Halted progress equates into longer stays, longer stays mean increased wait times for others waiting to access the program.</p>

No question, the goal and the mandate of the department is to ensure that any heritage or any significant areas in the province are protected, and we're more than willing to ensure that we do that. We've done it on several occasions in the last number of months.

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Madam Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. On April 18th the province and the Capital District Health Authority announced a joint review of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Raymond Taavel. A press release promised that a progress report on the review would be provided within 30 days. The review is due on or before this Friday.

They are worried because it appears that the tragedy of April 17th was not an isolated incident and we know that, because another patient has failed to return to the hospital within weeks of the announcement of the review.</p>

There is clearly not adequate space to pull off to the shoulder. If a driver was forced to veer to one side to avoid an animal or oncoming vehicle, they would end up in the ravine and, of course, this is unacceptable. So again to the minister, is this road going to be repaired soon?</p>

We have a plan in place to address these roads and many of the Opposition members have brought particular roads to my attention.

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Madam Speaker, yesterday when asked about Emera's decision to hold a swanky party on the Halifax waterfront for their executives, only a day after asking for yet another power rate increase, the Premier said, "It was ill-advised and very poor judgment on behalf of the company." Later we learned that very same company decided to fly the Premier to an announcement in St. John's on their corporate jet last November. All the while, the Premier is keeping Nova Scotians in the dark on what impact the Lower Churchill project will have on Nova Scotia's power bills. I guess he saves those decisions for the safe confines of Emera's corporate jet.</p>

Unfortunately, we have to put all the bills forward that are strictly government bills and, as I've said before, that is a process that is in desperate need of reform if we're going to work together in this House and try to put things forward. That doesn't seem to be the flavour at least of the current day and I know it has been an issue in the past.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to join the debate for just a few short remaining minutes in debate on Resolution No. 997. I think this is a moment where putting some kind of a summary, if you wish, on the past three years of the NDP Government can be seen in the context through Nova Scotia Power and what has gone on.</p>

This resolution was submitted just on Friday, I believe, and it relates to the petition that is on-line right now that has been started by the gentleman from Port Hawkesbury to call on the Government of Nova Scotia to oppose the rate hikes that have been proposed by Nova Scotia Power that we know are going to be brought forward.</p>

We know the stress and burden it puts on Nova Scotians every day. One of the things that the Opposition doesn't say over and over - we've been here for a number of weeks and we hear question after question from the Opposition members, from the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives, about why we're not doing this, why we're not doing that. But you have to know why we are in the position we're in today.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : That Renewable Electricity Plan puts forth a plan for Nova Scotians to get off the use of fossil fuels. We need to break that trend because fossil fuels, coal prices, have increased by 75 per cent in the last almost-decade - 75 per cent. That's why we're seeing the increases we have from Nova Scotia Power every year when they go to the URB. We're going to be there to ensure that the rates that they're asking, or the increase that they are asking - they need to prove that they're warranted.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker; they're not bothering me one bit. I know the message we need to make sure Nova Scotians hear and that's the truth and that's the history of why we're in the position we're in today. By taking the HST off electricity, do you realize how much that is saving Nova Scotians today? Last year for 2011-12, by us deciding to take the HST off electricity, that put $102.2 million back in the pockets of Nova Scotians. They don't talk about that. Over $100 million that would have been taken from Nova Scotians if the other two Parties were in power right now, $100 million.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Thank you. The other thing we did after forming government was to try to ensure that our seniors are taken care of here in Nova Scotia. That's why we ensured that any senior who is receiving the Guaranteed Income Supplement no longer pays provincial income tax. Under the former Progressive Conservative Government they paid that tax, just like they paid taxes on their heating, they paid those taxes too. They paid taxes on children's clothing and on feminine hygiene products. Under the Progressive Conservative Government, Nova Scotians paid more taxes. We're ensuring that we change the way government does business. We're turning the ship around.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : An hour ago. So it obviously means something to Nova Scotians. The Progressive Conservatives introduced a resolution today so that those 27,044 people and counting, can have their voice heard in the Legislature by having that petition tabled here so that we could debate it here but the government, the NDP voted it down. Mr. Speaker. I think this calls into question as well, you know, what is this government doing and I started off my remarks by saying that we're trying to bring ideas into the Legislature and every time we try to bring them in, we hear stories about blaming us for the past. We hear stories that you had your chance, it's too late for you now.</p>
