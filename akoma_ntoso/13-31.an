          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, former residents of the Home for Colored Children are saying that the Premier's panel is the wrong approach and will divide their community. Members of Ujamaa have reiterated this in their statement on April 5th, saying, "the panel suggested by the government will revictimize the victims and will not provide transparency and clarity to the African-Nova Scotian community."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the process that we are seeking to follow is exactly the one that was recommended not only by the VOICES group, but by other African Nova Scotian groups. We're doing so, of course, to promote reconciliation and healing, and to ensure that there is a full examination. We want all of this to take place compassionately, understanding that there is, at the same time, a legal process underway that is dealing with the question of compensation.</p>

The Premier knows that the panel put together by his government does not allow the voices of those victims to be heard and it does not have the legal requirement to force people to testify at a public inquiry to ensure that Nova Scotians know exactly what happened at that Home for Colored Children, and that the victims finally get their voices heard and get served justice in the Province of Nova Scotia, where it has been denied for decades.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, after many calls from both Opposition Parties and the former residents of the Home for Colored Children, the Premier actually had us believing that he may finally be taking those calls seriously about calling a full public inquiry. But then he sent his legal team in and had them quash the very stories in court that the residents were wanting to tell. Now we see that Tony Smith, the spokesperson for VOICES, has told reporters that they feel misled by what the Premier has said about his intentions around a public inquiry and I will table for the benefit of the Premier Mr. Smith's comments.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, no wonder VOICES and the former residents have lost faith in the way this government has handled their cause. Saying they don't " . . . propose a public inquiry per say [sic]." is not the same as the way the Premier characterizes which is that they were calling for some panel. That's not the same thing at all. To try to comfort them today by saying that the terms of reference for the panel will satisfy them when those terms of reference are not even written. In fact, I'll table the Premier's own release that says they have appointed someone to write them, it shows the kind of games that are being played on such an important issue.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Okay, Mr. Speaker, so let's call it what we want - let's call a full public inquiry. That has a definition in the Public Inquiries Act. It is what the residents are asking for. It is what Nova Scotians know leads to ultimate justice and the ability for the province to move on. Let's not call it something different, let's call a full public inquiry. As the Premier says, let's call it what it is, let's call what's needed. Then truly, the residents will know that they don't have a government that is playing games; that they don't have to go through some alternative process that doesn't satisfy their needs, so that years from now we are no further ahead.</p>

STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, today residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children had a press conference to share information about this government's active attempts to silence victims of abuse.

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in every answer that this Premier has given he never once mentioned the victims of this abuse - not once has he mentioned the victims. Let me tell you, in my first question today I quoted from a letter that he would have received from Ujamaa that is supporting the VOICES organization. It said Ujamaa Black family members held a meeting on the 5th and 6th to support VOICES organizations and their demand for a public inquiry. The panel suggested by the government will re-victimize the victims and will not provide transparency, clarity to the African Nova Scotia community.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition's assertions, besides being demeaning and insulting, are also untrue. They are, in fact, the furthest thing from the truth. In fact, the VOICES group, when we met with them said that we were the first government to ever take them seriously and meet with them - that is what they told us when they met with us. I can only say this, there is nothing that hasn't been completely transparent in what we have done. At every turn we have tried to accommodate the desires of the VOICES group.</p>

Members from the African Nova Scotia community, VOICES people, victims have asked this government for a full, open, public inquiry.

I have made myself available, whether they are victims, whether they are represented by the VOICES group, whether they are represented by other groups, it didn't matter to me. What I wanted to understand was what the best route, best path forward is. I spent years in the courts, I know very well how adversarial those proceedings are.

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, the NDP track record for election financing is abysmal. During the 2009 election campaign, the NDP took illegal donations from unions that totalled $45,000. When they were discovered, the NDP promised to return the illegal donations, but misled the public and failed to do so. The offence was so egregious and serious in nature that Elections Nova Scotia levelled its first-ever fine of such a nature to the Premier and his NDP, with the largest fine possible under the law.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Today a new report entitled Can Nova Scotians Afford to Eat Healthy? was released. It's a food costing report for 2012 produced by FoodARC, which concludes that over the last four years families in Nova Scotia are having more and more trouble feeding their own families nutritious food because of the cost - and I will share that with the House and with the Premier, Mr. Speaker.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the suggestion made by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is outrageous for the following reasons. First of all we inherited the Nova Scotia Power regime from the Progressive Conservative Government and the reason why power rates went is because they tied us to fossil fuel rates year after year after year. Secondly, with respect to the question of taxation we actually created the Affordable Tax Credit, the Poverty Reduction Tax Credit which actually takes some of that tax increase, in fact much more of it than they would have paid in tax and puts it into the pockets of those people who are the worst off, meaning that they have more money to buy the things that they need for them and their families.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it's sad to see that the Premier seems to be telling our families here in Nova Scotia who are struggling to get by that the NDP answer is that they should go under income assistance under his government, but that is not a good enough answer. The report shows that a family of four trying to eat healthy in 2012 - that cost 26 per cent more than it did five short years ago. In some areas of Nova Scotia like Cape Breton, like Guysborough, Cumberland County it cost even more than that. Perhaps that's why in our rural areas the 10,300 people have moved away in the last four years - and I'll table that - and 6,200 have lost their full-time jobs.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we changed the system in order to put more money in the pockets of exactly those people. In fact, as I said, the Affordable Living Tax Credit, the Poverty Reduction Credit puts more money in their pocket. We invested in job growth; we invested in ensuring that there was a minimum wage that was enough to support people; we have supported young people graduating from university, with a Graduate Retention Rebate. Right across the board, where people have found themselves without the financial security they need, they have found the support of this government.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians not only deserve a better response than that, they deserve better from the NDP Government when it comes to addressing wait times. After all, $34 million in federal funding specifically for wait time reduction and how does government spend the money? They put it into general revenue to help balance the books. To add insult to injury this NDP Government during its mandate has spent close to $1 million advertising their Better Care Sooner plan - well, how ironic.</p>

He mentions $34 million of federal transfers coming into the province, we appreciate the minimal support that we do get from the federal government, we spend $3.9 billion in health care, we spend that to ensure that people have access to the health care services that they need, unlike when the last round of Ministers of Health from the Liberal Government flew around firing nurses, closing hospital beds. We're working with district health authorities to ensure that they have the services Nova Scotians need.</p>

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, the 2012 report of the Participatory Food Costing project shows the amount of money it costs for families and individuals to eat healthy in Nova Scotia. The report takes into consideration the rising cost of power, transportation, taxes and food. You know after a family receiving Income Assistance pays their bills and puts food on the table, that family is $758 in the hole, and at the end of the month a single mother, earning minimum wage, will be left $823 in the hole once she feeds her children.

Everyone in this House knows just how important the lobster fishery is to the economies of rural Nova Scotia and to the economy of our entire province.

That is why we have met, consistently, with our federal counterpart, Mr. Ashfield, and the Atlantic Ministers of Fisheries.

I would love to have the opportunity to talk about diversifying the fisheries and creating more jobs in the rural communities. This is something that's very important to us.

We have dozens of applications and I think at the last count we had 60-some approvals for COMFIT projects. This could be for small wind, they could be for large wind, they could be for tidal, or they could be sustainable biomass or farm biomass.

I'm still trying to figure out the Liberal energy plan. I know some days they talk about putting the HST back on, some days they want to take it off. They want to eliminate Efficiency Nova Scotia. They're going to deregulate electricity, that's a 30 to 50 per cent increase. We know the model in New Brunswick is not working. They want to cosy up to Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec.

Yesterday as the government members well know - maybe the Minister of Energy should start showing up for briefings because of course what New Brunswick did yesterday was not at all take out renewable, in fact they said that was one of the things that is working and they've kept that in the bill in the legislation they introduced yesterday, sorry to disappoint.

Has the minister talked to the mill about looking at ways to reduce regulations that may be hurting profits in the trucking industry?
