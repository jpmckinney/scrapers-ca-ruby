          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : I want to thank the minister for providing us with a copy of his statement earlier today. On behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus, I am very pleased to see that Nova Scotia is becoming a leader in this area. After all, the Mental Health Foundation of Nova Scotia tells us that mental illness directly affects all Canadians at some time, through a family member, friend, or colleague.</p>

You know, Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting topic. There is probably not one of us in this Legislature that hasn't at some time been asked to participate in a fundraiser for a community member, a family member, anybody even remotely close to us, if there is an illness, whether it's cancer or issues like that. The communities are so great to get behind and support these worthwhile causes.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Yesterday the Premier's efficiency fee shell game actually got an endorsement from the Ecology Action Centre. Catherine Abreu of the Ecology Action Centre said (Applause) Better wait for the quote. She actually said that it's "always better" for ratepayers to pay for conservation programs. That is, of course, the opposite of what the Premier promised Nova Scotians when he guaranteed them that their efficiency fees would be paid for out of Nova Scotia Power's profits.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the fact that we finally have a government that is leading energy policy in this place to the best interest of Nova Scotian ratepayers. Power rates will be going down January 1st, and the efficiency tax will come off every power bill in the province. That's $46 million in savings, and I think that what the Ecology Action Centre said was that the only way that any Nova Scotian would pay for efficiency programs was if it actually was a cheaper fuel source, which in turn would drive power rates down even further.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Actually, Mr. Speaker, what Nova Scotians are continuing to look for is a government that does what it says it will do in the election, not the opposite. But Ms. Abreu had a lot to say about the government shell game. In commending the Premier for charging the efficiency fee right back onto the pocketbooks of Nova Scotians, Ms. Abreu of the Ecology Action Centre said that, "What we've seen in this bill is acknowledgment that the situation was perhaps more complicated than the [Premier's] promise suggested."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I will inform the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is that we promised Nova Scotians that we would remove the efficiency tax off every power bill; that will happen as of January 1, 2015. On top of that, we didn't stop there. We now are going to continue to drive down fuel sources so that power rates will continue to drop. Why is the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party afraid to allow Nova Scotians to pay less for power rates?</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, if they were truly to going to pay less, we'd all cheer that, of course, but when a government promises to take the fee off our bill and then allows the power company to charge it right back on to our bills again in another line, that's not reducing our power rates. That's a shell game, and a complicated one at that.</p>

          <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. Nurses are the backbone of our health care system and they work extremely hard to care for their patients and they want to be treated with dignity and respect. After the Liberal Government's essential services legislation, repairing the relationships between nurses and their employer is of the utmost importance.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that has become clear to me after four years of that government, not only is there repair work to be done between nurses and Capital Health, there is repair to be done between every organization in the Government of Nova Scotia. It is why I'm so proud of the Minister of Health and Wellness, who very clearly said he is going around talking to health care providers, those who deliver services to the people of this province and one thing is certain, we will move from an administrative-focused health care system to one that is clearly focused on patients.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, we have learned recently that 100 nurses at Capital Health are being called in by their employer for what Capital Health is calling investigative meetings into their protest activities, the first step into the possibility of disciplinary action. Does the Premier believe investigative meetings and disciplinary action will help repair the relationship between nurses and Capital Health or will he ask the administration at Capital Health to respect health care workers' rights to speak out on behalf of their patients?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the Leader of the New Democratic Party is referring to. That is something between the employer and those who work for the employer. One thing that I will tell the Leader of the New Democratic Party, quite frankly, is, as we've said all along in the debate, there have been issues raised about the staffing on floors not only in the Capital Region but across the province. The Minister of Health and Wellness has said he is going to investigate. The difference between us and the NDP is that we don't believe everything has to end up in the collective bargaining process.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, health care workers' morale has sunk to a new low because of the actions of that government. Yesterday in Estimates, when discussing changes to the nursing strategy, the Minister of Health and Wellness said, satisfaction in the workplace is key and that he hopes nurses will stay in the province. The threat of disciplinary action seems pretty unlikely to improve nurses' morale. My question for the Premier is, what will he do to ensure nurses in our province aren't driven to leave Nova Scotia because they don't feel respected, they feel threatened?</p>

He is going around talking to nurses and talking to Nova Scotians about the issues that they face, quite frankly, which didn't show up on October 22nd, they were there long before we took power. As a matter of fact, I would daresay they were there when that member was Minister of Health and Wellness. The difference between this Party and that Party is that we're listening and we will respond.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, all Nova Scotians are waiting for a real plan from this government about their power rates, not just a complicated, elaborate shell game. They are rightly worried that by changing governments, when it comes to power, really nothing has changed, that rate increases lie in their future.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it's pretty obvious that the only message that government has delivered to Nova Scotia Power is to put off a rate increase to a future day, and charge interest to the ratepayers of Nova Scotia who are still going to get that bill. That's the sad reality - after being promised that the efficiency charge would be paid for out of the profits of the power company, it turns out the biggest defender of those profits is the new Premier of Nova Scotia. That is what's wrong.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. It has been 25 years since the Marshall Inquiry. That report led to Donald Marshall, Jr. being compensated for a wrongful conviction. The commissioners found that the mistreatment of minorities also extended to the Black community. The commission had recommended that when a person is wrongfully convicted, an independent judicial inquiry be held to consider a compensation claim. Does the Minister of Justice agree with the lessons learned from the Marshall Inquiry?</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that the minister is speaking about was still wrongfully convicted. We all know of Gerald Barton, a young Black man at the time of the alleged offence. He was wrongfully convicted and labelled a sex offender. We know that doors were likely closed to him over the course of his life for jobs and other opportunities. He actually said in 2012, "I am not angry. It was a dirty trick they played on me. They threw me in jail, like I was nothing, and I don't think that's right. And they never even stopped to ask if I was guilty."</p>

In cases of this sort, they are sometimes more complex than what you hear in the media. As I stated before, I certainly feel for anybody that has gone through what Mr. Barton has gone through. I sympathize, I have a lot of remorse and it simply is unfair what he went through. Again, the case is still in front of the courts. Thank you.</p>

In August a Grant Thornton report stated that without outside intervention the Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition Commission in Truro was on a collision course with bankruptcy. The Minister of Agriculture, in January, ordered a forensic audit because the commission owed the province $450,000, had not been making loan payments, and was refusing to hand over its financial data. In total, the commission is $1.1 million in debt, which includes more than $200,000 it owes to racetracks across North America.</p>

          <p>HON. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, as the mother of three children, I can tell you that I am very aware of what students go through as they go through their post-secondary education. I have one daughter who graduated several years ago and is unable to work because of illness. I have another daughter who is about to graduate and will go into the job market. Fortunately for her, she has one waiting for her. I have another child who is in high school. So we're very aware of the cost of education.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I don't know what the minister reads to inform herself about the debt load that students in this province carry but it has been well documented in many reports that students in our province carry some of the highest debt loads in the country because they face some of the highest costs in the country for their tuition. (Interruption) I hear members on the government side saying no, that is not the case. But I would recommend that they inform themselves because the data is clear on this. We have among the highest tuition costs in the country and debt loads are among the highest in the country. That's just a fact.</p>

Young people in the workforce are one issue and people in post-secondary education have different issues. That is exactly why so many student groups actually recommended eliminating the Graduate Retention Rebate, because they wanted money put into post-secondary education. They have very different views and very different needs.</p>

          <p>MS. PATRICIA ARAB : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. My riding of Fairview-Clayton Park has the highest number of refugees and new immigrants in Atlantic Canada. The children in these families come into our education system and immediately begin the process of becoming multi-lingual, learning English as an additional language. Having EAL learners in our system can be seen as a negative or a hurdle that must be overcome. We need to change the perspective and highlight our EAL learners, not as students to present a challenge but instead as gifted learners who will leave our education system with knowledge and proficiency in at least two different languages.</p>

Parents who started arriving at the Cobequid Children's Centre in Sackville at 6:00 a.m. yesterday found the doors locked and no trace of the owners.

KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, it is a very unfortunate situation that the parents found themselves with they arrived at the daycare; the door was locked and there had been no notice. It is in violation of what we ask all daycares to do and that is to provide a 120-day notice to both the parents and the families of the children who use those services and to the department. I will say here, and I've said in the media, that no notice was given either to the parents and families or to the department.</p>

Parents are now missing work and scrambling to find care for their children, so my question to the minister is, will the minister indicate how much money concerning subsidies to these families and subsidies to the daycare were being paid out and, if so, how much money in advance was paid out by the department to the daycare?</p>

          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : My question today is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. The stretch of Highway No. 104 between Sutherland's River and Antigonish is one that has seen many devastating accidents. Students travelling to St. F.X., tourists, residents, and even the minister, use this stretch of highway pretty regularly. In the past five years there have been more than 65 motor vehicle accidents and nine fatalities on that stretch of highway, but despite all this there is no mention of the twining of this section in the department's five-year highway improvement plan. My question today for the minister is, will the minister commit to twinning this stretch of road given how dangerous it is?</p>

          <p>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN : The member is certainly correct that Highway No. 104 is a stretch of highway that I use twice weekly and now many members of the House, and of course commuters across the province, access. The reality is - and, again, well taken with the points about the injuries and the collisions and, of course, the fatalities - there is no member of this House, government or otherwise, who wants to see those types of things happen on our roadways, as it is all about Nova Scotians and road safety is our priority.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : I know it must be difficult to prioritize which roads are done when and I guess I'm just a little curious about the metrics the department uses to prioritize the major projects like this. Not only is this stretch of road dangerous, but the toll it takes on the volunteer firefighters who respond to the scene of these accidents is pretty devastating. Barney's River Fire Chief Joe MacDonald recently wrote a letter to the department urging that they make the twinning of this section a priority. Mr. MacDonald says it scares him how many people have died or were seriously hurt on the stretch of highway through his district just in the past few years. My question today to the minister would be, what can the minister share with me that I can go back and tell Fire Chief Joe MacDonald about the twinning of this stretch?</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, certainly the safety of Nova Scotians is paramount when it comes to considering whether or not this priority becomes a priority. Beyond that, there are economic benefits that our province could realize by twinning this stretch. Trucking companies cannot use longer-combination vehicles on single-lane highways, and products could be moved more efficiently and reach more Nova Scotians if this stretch of highway were twinned.</p>

The people we've talked to about their tires feel like they have "A-Rod" broken in them, or something like that. Since this minister became in charge of roads, they feel more like the Dodgers, dodging the potholes from one end of the province to the other.

That is a program that is showing great success, and I'm proud that as the Minister of Community Services I could bring that to the people of Nova Scotia. (Applause)</p>
