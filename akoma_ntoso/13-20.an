          <from>HON. MARILYN MORE</from>
          <p>HON. MARILYN MORE : Mr. Speaker, I rise today about an issue that has touched every member in this House and affects everyone we represent in our constituencies. A lot of the discussion is focused on cyberbullying and technology, which are changing the world around us at a rapid place, but technology is only a tool. The reason that technology tools are used to cause hurt and harm link to broader issues around sexual violence, issues that have evolved over generations and are not unique to Nova Scotia. They require a collective, continuing effort and I appreciate the cooperation and support of every member of this House. I am asking all members today, government and opposition alike, to join my commitment to do whatever I can to better protect young girls and all victims of violence and bullying.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise and speak to the minister's statement about cyberbullying and technology today, including sexual violence against our young people. The world is certainly a very different place than when many of us, all of us in this Chamber went to school, started out in life. I know that we all are determined to see that our laws federally and provincially are modernized to reflect today's reality and protect the 21st Century's version of young Nova Scotians. Indeed, there are gaps in the Criminal Code that need to be closed. I know the Premier and I have both communicated to the Prime Minister of Canada about the need to modernize the Criminal Code.</p>

        <speech by="#8fad494a-14a2-43cc-9056-2453c96e522e">
          <from>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the CBRM Mayor and Council, Island MLAs and MPs, and many residents, were encouraged by the commitment from the provincial government to support the municipality with 25 cents for every federal dollar allocated for the CBRM capital plan. While this is a great starting point, we'd like the province to clarify their commitment to our capital plan. As indicated by the CBRM, if the province matches our municipality's investment, we could begin to see the benefits of this plan in this current fiscal year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to meet with the Mayor and members of the CBRM Council and to review their capital plan today. I reiterated the commitment that we have already made. They asked me about whether or not - if money was to come forward in this year. I indicated to them that I would be happy to consider that, if it happens. We want to encourage the federal investment in the province and certainly we would encourage the effective use of our money to trigger a larger investment in CBRM, or for that matter, in other parts of the province.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>MR. MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Cape Breton's employment numbers are certainly alarming: 18.6 per cent unemployment and climbing. Mr. Speaker, the highest unemployment in any city in Atlantic Canada is in Sydney, out-migration of thousands of families over the last number of years, and ownership of $454 million in waste-water improvements in the next decade - a cost that we simply can't afford. This plan will keep families home. It will put tradespeople back to work, and it will grow the Cape Breton economy, which has certainly experienced negative growth for a number of years. Plain and simple, our municipality needs this, so to clarify again for the Premier, if the federal government commits to the CBRM capital plan, will the Premier live up to his commitment for the 2013-14 fiscal year?</p>

What I told them was that we would be prepared to go back and reconsider the capital plan if money was available, because we want to make use of any investment that would come from the federal government and we're happy to do that. I also explained that the capital planning for the province takes place in the Fall, so that they would know for future years that this is the best way to prepare for budgeting. I also indicated to them that what would be very important to the CBRM are investments, good investments in jobs like IIBG, like the Maritime Link, which would be very beneficial to the people of Cape Breton. So maybe the next time the member for Glace Bay stands up, maybe he can say whether or not he would support those investments.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the CBRM has constructed a real plan for the economy in Cape Breton. This plan will address the crumbling infrastructure, get hundreds of Cape Breton tradespeople back to work, and provide a much-needed injection into the local economy and, indeed, the economy of the entire province. This also has potential to bridge the gap to new opportunities related to port initiatives, natural resource development, and tourism expansion. But for this to succeed the Premier needs to ensure that the capital plan is presented to the federal government as a provincial priority, one that the entire province can get behind. So my question is, will the Premier confirm in this House right now that he is willing to put the plan forward to the federal government as a provincial priority for the Province of Nova Scotia?</p>

We've reiterated in letters. I've answered this here before. My hope, though, is that on the wider question associated with economic development, the member opposite - the members opposite for that matter - will recognize the kinds of investments that are necessary by government in business in order to ensure that there is real economic development and growth in areas like Cape Breton and understand that when we make commitments, whether it's companies like IIBG or to the Maritime Link, or to Port Hawkesbury Paper, they are important for the growth of the economy in that region.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, CBRM's capital plan addresses much-needed projects and community infrastructure. Cape Breton has been hit hard by unemployment, out-migration, and the CBRM has a plan to bring new life to the crumbling capital and local infrastructure. The reality is that the potential of this new capital plan is contingent on a commitment from the province. My question to the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations is, does the province currently have the money they've promised for CBRM?

STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in a recent TV appearance, when asked about cyberbullying, the Premier responded that in order for people to take this seriously, there has to be a criminal sanction. The Minister of Education's appointed task force on cyberbullying submitted its recommendations to government in February 2012, and Recommendation 44 states that it is recommended that ". . . the provincial Minister of Justice make representations to the federal Minister of Justice about evaluating the effectiveness of current Criminal Code provisions in responding to bullying and cyberbullying and exploring the pros and cons of a distinct crime of bullying and cyberbullying."</p>

MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, yesterday I asked the Minister of Justice about why our justice system failed the victims of abuse in the Fenwick MacIntosh case, and why it failed all Nova Scotians. I asked the minister if he would order an independent inquiry into these matters and the minister flatly refused.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, first of all I'll just correct the member for Richmond - the minister did not refuse. In fact, he pointed out, I believe, to the House that there is already an internal review that is underway. I understand that today, in Ottawa, one of the colleagues of the member for Richmond actually asked for a federal inquiry into this matter, and for good reason. It appears that over the period that this thing was under consideration, this case was under consideration, there was some 14 years where twice the federal government, through their officials, went ahead and issued passports to Mr. MacIntosh despite the fact that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the Premier knows and I have acknowledged already that the federal government has a role in this, there's no question. But the investigation started in Nova Scotia. The question is, why did investigators in Nova Scotia take so long and not push this matter further? Second, once Mr. MacIntosh finally arrived back in the country it took the Public Prosecution Service of Nova Scotia - and the Premier being a lawyer knows that right away there were concerns with the delays that he was going to argue that this wasn't brought in a timely manner - it took three full years for the Public Prosecution Service to even walk through the doors of a courtroom with this case.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I don't actually disagree with much of what the member for Richmond has said. The Fenwick MacIntosh case is a deeply disturbing case and why it is that it took as long as it took to get to where it should have - regardless of whether or not the prosecution service was issuing warrants for arrest and all of the other things it has done - I believe it does need to be reviewed. There is an internal review going on now. We know that there is a federal responsibility with respect to this. I want to see the end of the internal review.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Again, Mr. Speaker, there is no one else that would like to see that more than myself, that both levels would be looked at. At the same time I don't think anyone is advocating having two separate independent inquiries take place. It would be the preference that there be one. But unfortunately we have a division of powers at play here and what the federal government will do is outside of our control here in this Legislature, but we know what our province can do.</p>

But they are competing with Sept-&#xCE;les, Quebec, for those same jobs. Sydney has a lot going for it: it has the better workforce; it has a better port; it's got a better location for trade and for the bringing of supplies and materials. But because of this government, Sydney has one other thing to consider and that is that they pay the highest power rates in all of Canada, something that is important to actually attracting good jobs.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure I'm not the only one who can't believe the audacity of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the Party that created the power rates of today, the Party that privatized Nova Scotia Power, the Party that tied us to expensive, fossil-fuel-driven electricity. If anything, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the next time he stands up, should apologize to Nova Scotians for forcing communities to compete with one hand tied behind their back.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I want every Nova Scotian to look at their power bill this month, because they will see that it is orange and the reason it is orange is because today's power prices are all the responsibility of the current government and the current Premier. That's what Cape Breton is up against - 1,800 jobs lost under this government since they came in. What we don't know is, on top of those jobs that are lost, how many are not coming here at all because places like Sydney are competing with one hand tied behind their back for new jobs and investments?</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, two years ago this month the Premier made a commitment to the families of autistic children from one end of the province to the other - the Premier committed to doubling funding for EIBI from its 2005-06 level of $4 million to $8 million, so that in the words of the Premier "children living with autism should have access to the best treatment as early as possible to give them the best chance for success now and in the future."

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we're very proud of the fact that instead of leaving what was in place, where EIBI funding meant that there was simply a lottery where some kids got access to the services that they needed and others did not, we are committed to ensuring that all children get access to these services. That's what the budget does. In addition to EIBI, we put in place a range of other supports that also support children on the autism spectrum.</p>

The Premier indicated two years ago that every preschool child in Nova Scotia who needed the EIBI program for more than one year would get it. Perhaps this government's agenda is such that if we slow down assessments, we can cut the treatment budget.</p>

It is pathetic when parents who are dealing with questions associated with the health of their children are actively misled by a member of the Legislature. The budget for EIBI was $2 million, and it's now $4 million. We are ensuring that children who are on the autism spectrum are getting the support they need.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the reality is that this Premier did not keep the promise that said the EIBI program would move from $4 million to $8 million; it's right in the speech that I just tabled. That's exactly what was said. Two years ago, this Premier made a grand announcement about EIBI support and he had broken his word. He spoke about the unfairness of a lottery system for EIBI and how his government was going to fix it once and for all so no family would be denied. This Premier not only failed to fulfill his full commitment of doubling the EIBI budget to a full $8 million but he has cut the budget back to the 2005-06 level of $4 million. Obviously, the Premier likes the flash of announcements, but when he thinks everyone's back is turned, he decides it would be acceptable to balance the budget on the backs of autistic children and their families in this province.</p>

The reality is that we made commitments to people which we stand by, which we keep. We ensure that the kids who need these services get them. They have in their caucus a Minister of Health who with respect to this did absolutely nothing. We are ensuring that there are appropriate services in place. We are living up to the commitments we made to those parents and to those kids. That caucus brought forward for us recommendations, for example, with respect to insulin pumps for kids, and then broke that commitment by voting against the very budget that implemented it.</p>

We learned last week that unemployment in Cape Breton has soared to 18.6 per cent, and I'll table the document to back that up. Statistics Canada shows that provincially we have an unemployment-to-job ratio of 15 to one. And I'll table that document. It's obvious that with such high unemployment in Cape Breton, that the ratio at home would be much higher than the provincial average. So, my question to the minister is, will the minister admit that their economic plan has been an absolute disaster for the people of Cape Breton?</p>

There are over 11,000 - I repeat, 11,000 - unemployed people in Cape Breton. Along with the job losses, people are also losing hope. They're losing hope.

The money that we've seen, the growth in health care spending over the last number of years leading into us coming into government was increasing exponentially. We had some of the highest increases in the country, but yet we continued to see wait times grow. So we've taken the approach that we tried to change models of care.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy. On April 18th Moody's Investors Service assigned a AAA-backed issuer rating to Emera for the Muskrat Falls project. The reason for this high grade rating is because they said there is no risk to the company in the project, and those companies, of course, being Nova Scotia Power, Emera, and Nalcor, and I will table the Moody's rating. There is no risk to the companies because of course all the risk is going to be borne by Nova Scotia ratepayers on the Maritime Link project. Why does the minister feel that eliminating the risk for a very profitable private company such as Emera is a good idea and shifting it to ratepayers is also a good idea?</p>

There were other options, of course; this project could have moved ahead under a different type of deal where Emera would have taken the risk and any strategic benefits of the undersea connection could still be realized, as found by Synapse, the board's own consultant, and I'll table that.</p>

COMFIT is the Community Feed-In Tariff that has been very popular in this province and many municipalities and non-profit groups are looking at that. Green energy is what this government is committed to and Muskrat Falls is certainly an important part of that but again, the URB has the role and responsibly to look at all the evidence, including the interveners, including the experts who have testified.

That's how important they were to this government. This government is so focused on protecting Emera that last year it signed an agreement with the company to not negatively impact it through regulatory charges, and I'll table the Premier's press release. I'm sure most businesses wished the province would have signed such a deal with them, instead of burdening them with 1,400 higher user fees, a reduced threshold for the small-business tax, and ever increasing power rates but as always the NDP sides with Emera and not small business owners. It's so bad that Credit Suisse and the report I tabled just calls the hearings regulatory noise.

        <heading>FIN. - RETAIL SALES: HST REVENUE - FIGURES EXPLAIN</heading>
        <speech by="#044d7a53-b109-4393-8fbe-efad8b86a796">
          <from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. As everyone knows, the 2013-14 budget is based on extremely optimistic revenue projections for the province. HST revenue, which is reliant on retail sales and transactions, is estimated to grow by an additional $78.9 million, or almost 5 per cent. But just this week we received retail sales figures from Statistics Canada that show a far more sombre reality. Nova Scotia had negative retail sales growth in all measures; on a month-over-month, year-to-date, and year-over-year basis, retail sales decreased 0.6 per cent, 2.2 per cent, and 1.6 per cent - all three of them decreasing.</p>

          <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as I've said here before, the revenue forecast for this year's budget passed last night. For the first time in a decade, it received the unqualified opinion of the Auditor General. We're prepared with the consultation process of all of the senior economists in the major financial institutions in the country and other important organizations such as the Conference Board of Canada and APEC. Those forecasts, those assumptions were supported as being reasonable assumptions, given the progress this government has made and the fact that we are about to turn the corner on 20 years of the worst economic performance under previous governments.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, there's no turning the corner; they're burying their heads in the sand is what's happening. The revenue projected from HST will be dependent on people working and having disposable income to buy cars, electronics, and everything else. While retail sales are down, next year's projections for employment are also down. It has been projected that there will be 1,100 fewer jobs in Nova Scotia next year, and the Budget Assumptions document that we were given projects an unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent in 2013-14, which is actually higher - in other words worse - than it is today. So with higher unemployment projected for the coming year, the likelihood of any significant increase in HST revenue is very unlikely.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, the government's own Budget Assumptions document which was passed out to every member of the House here, along with the budget information, shows indicators like high unemployment, flat population growth, more part-time work, and more - all negative figures. None of these would support a marked increase in HST revenue or in personal income tax revenue.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I would think that the honourable member would be aware that while retail sales are very important and yes, in fact, have a relationship bearing on HST revenue, they're certainly not the only driver of HST revenue. One of the most significant drivers of HST revenue, in fact, is construction. In the area of construction, once again, Nova Scotia is in a very, very strong position. All you have to do is look around the HRM and you see the construction that is going on. (Interruptions)</p>

          <from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Port Hawkesbury Paper is in an industry that's highly stressed. Paper products are not used as much as they once were, and although we do hear good reports about the mill, that it's achieving success with sales orders, we do know that the industry is stressed. And now that the mill is up and running, wood suppliers are one of the costs for the mill. And they are now under stress as well, because they're called upon to provide wood to the mill at a very competitive price so the mill can sell paper at a competitive price.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, certainly I thank the member for the opportunity to, I guess maybe, continue our dialogue that we had in the estimates. It sounds very similar to what we had previously discussed. But as we know, when there were challenges there in that mill, our Premier stepped up and immediately met with the workers and their families and the businesses in the area and the Forestry Infrastructure Fund was put in place, as well as the Hot Idle initiative, and kept that mill alive and kept the opportunity to create good jobs, 1,400 good jobs in the community. And some of those are in the woods, in the contracting and woods operators, and truckers, and silviculture contractors, and so on.</p>

          <from>MR. PARKER</from>
          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, we know the value of the forest industry to this province, and certainly as I indicated in the earlier response, we kept the forest industry alive through the troubling period we had, and now with the new operator things are once again on much more stable ground. The silviculture rates, I understand, are under review, we're looking at that, and we will continue to work with the stakeholders in the industry, and of course prices depend on supply and demand, you know, the market conditions. Certainly with the two large pulp mills in eastern and central regions of the province there is some competition, and that's a good thing for the private woodlot owner.</p>

          <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, another issue that's been raised is the amount of wood that's being purchased from New Brunswick. And, of course, when wood is purchased out of province, we don't have the same silviculture fees going back into our province, so that's affecting these suppliers as well. But I do know that part of the agreement with Port Hawkesbury Paper is that they are to buy 200,000 tons of pulpwood from private Nova Scotia suppliers each year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#50073f98-101e-4a05-aef5-b6739b325fb8">
          <from>MR. PARKER</from>
          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, initially, when the mill started up last September, there was a contract to provide 200,000 tons from private woodlot owners, and there were some challenges in meeting that in the first three months, so there was a small amount of wood, I understand, that was purchased from New Brunswick. Since that time there's been no wood purchased from out of province. And so 200,000 tons was the quota, out of the 600,000 tons, a third was the commitment to private woodlot owners. My understanding now is that the arrangements have been made with various sawmillers and private woodlot co-operatives and owners, and actually it's almost half - it's actually 48 per cent of the wood is now being purchased from private woodlot owners in eastern Nova Scotia.</p>

          <from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Immigration. It has been said that the community-identified stream provides rural communities with their best opportunity to get the economic benefits of immigration. In 2011 the number of nominee certificates under that community-identified stream was 146 and that means 146 families that went to rural parts of the province. The success of the stream is solely attributable to the former RDAs. Their hard work ensured the benefits of immigration were spread across the province and not centralized just in the urban core.</p>

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day it's the Office of Immigration and to a point - I like the encouragement from across the way - it's the federal government. We will continue to work with RENs when they develop and work with them as champions for rural Nova Scotia, especially as it relates to immigration issues.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I'm not very happy with that answer because there's a gap in our system for immigration to rural areas. I hope the minister will be looking into this. The RDAs provided not only the identification of community, people who could come and immigrate to their areas, they also provided the newcomer navigators and support that helped people stay in those areas, so it was a very important part of immigration to rural Nova Scotia. The provincial nominee stream and the work done in communities throughout the province help all rural communities.</p>

          <p>MR. CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, the theme of today is, what part of yes don't they understand? We will work with the RDAs (Interruption) - and I know the member for Glace Bay wants me to talk for a minute and a half, but no, because it wouldn't be fair because I'm sure that the member has another supplementary. The thing is we are working with these groups and it is community focused, we understand that, and we were working with these groups. It's not as they would portray it. It is a fact that we are working with all individuals and all communities to grow our immigration.</p>

That's what is important and that's what is being missed. It's very important that the government replace that service on the ground in rural Nova Scotia. That is the purpose of my question today - on the ground. The minister has not provided an answer about who is going to provide the service in the absence of the RDA.</p>

Astute watchers of the Legislature will note that this bill is slightly different than the last version because, of course, after a year of arguing against it, the NDP Government actually finally adopted one of the parts of this bill which was removing the bonuses from executive salaries, which was included in the original version of this bill and, of course, we all remember the government spent over a year saying it wasn't necessary, it was a bad idea and then finally adopted that Liberal idea. In fact, it's one after another that they are adopting some of them.</p>

          <p>MR. MACKINNON : He said thank you. Yes, he did. He said thank you, and I remember that day when there were workers with tears in their eyes. I remember one man saying to me - his two sons were working with him at the facility there, and he said - I'm trying to remember the quote, but it was something like, I believe my sons will have jobs here for the rest of their working lives. That was a proud day, a very proud day, in Nova Scotia when we heard that.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : There is no guarantee any of us will be here. Call an election, and we'll see how many are going to be here. It's amazing that any business in the province can actually compete with the conditions they have. We were talking about threats to jobs, and since this government has been in power there has been no real threat to jobs. It's been jobs that have gone. The threat's not there - it's actually happening. If this bill can put some transparency into what this government is doing today, then that's a good thing, but I don't know if this government would take this bill, because I don't know if they want to see what's going on. If we can create jobs, we're all for it.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : I'm delighted to rise in my place this evening to speak to Bill No. 1. This bill is aimed at introducing transparency to economic development assistance packages developed and pursued by government. A Liberal Government would end corporate handouts, would end the NDP practice of writing blank cheques with no job guarantees, and would work toward diversifying the economy of Nova Scotia. In fact, I think this is exactly the kind of bill that the NDP would have championed back when they were in Opposition. No one could express outrage better than the NDP when they were in Opposition. They would have . . .</p>
