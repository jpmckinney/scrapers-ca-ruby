        <speech by="#3d2afb09-46bb-45b0-8cdb-90ba97b15ed0">
          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. The federal Finance Minister has signalled that Ottawa will not keep increasing health transfers by 6 per cent beyond the current agreement. This government has already directed cuts to health of $46 million which, when you combine with inflation projections, have a potential to affect the Health budget by more than $90 million. The $46 million cuts were based on the assumptions of certain envelopes and among other sources of money, obviously, to the federal health transfer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, as you would know, the federal health transfer arrangement still has some time to run. We're not expecting to see any impact in that in this year or for that matter next year. There was an agreement over the course of the election that that would be extended for, I think they said two years. The important thing for people to know, though, is that although it has been kind of widely reported that Nova Scotia has a 6 per cent escalator in health care funding, that's not actually true.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#3d2afb09-46bb-45b0-8cdb-90ba97b15ed0">
          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I believe the Premier is correct, I believe the program will be extended to 2015, 2016, with the federal government. The Premier has already insisted that our provincial health care system make 3 per cent cuts this year. Now the federal Conservatives are indicating that they will be making cuts to health transfers when the current agreement runs out. This is going to put a tremendous strain on the provincial health care system at a time when we are dealing with an aging population and a low economic growth.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : First let me begin by thanking the Leader of the Official Opposition for recognizing the continuing role of this government past 2016. I think that's a significant watermark in the House, Mr. Speaker, but furthermore, what I would say is that the question of health care funding in our country is one that will come back to the forefront as these health care negotiations come to the forefront and what we have said is that over the last number of years, despite a significant escalator, there has been a slide in the actual percentage of health care costs in the province that are covered by the contribution of the federal government. In fact, it has gone from 23 per cent, and I believe this year will actually slide below 20 per cent in terms of the contribution of the federal government.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that if the Premier were to check Hansard, whenever it's out, I never suggested this government would be there in 2015, 2016. What I suggested was that the federal program would be there until 2015, 2016. I would strongly suggest that the Premier not be arrogant enough to prejudge what Nova Scotians will do in the next election. (Applause)</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, obviously we would be concerned about any cut to federal transfers. One of the realities of the relationship between the federal and provincial governments is that we have many, many transfers that take place. I think we have something in the order of 32 different agreements which result in transfers to the province for the purposes of providing services to the people of Nova Scotia. We are equally aware of the necessity of that funding to continue in each one of those envelopes. The reality is that you could get a very good agreement on health care transfers, but if you lose on the other 31 agreements, that has the same effect on the overall budget of the province. It means there's simply less money coming in.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, every day it becomes more clear that this Premier loves to advertise - perhaps he should get an audition for the TV show Mad Men. The latest example: his government is spending at least $160,000 on its new Our Future Starts Here marketing campaign. My question to the Premier is, how can he justify spending at least $160,000 of taxpayers' money on an advertising campaign during these tough economic times?</p>

BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, what the people of Nova Scotia want the government to do is to do the real work of taking advantage of the shipyard opportunity, not spend more of their money patting themselves on the back and taking credit for it. It's funny how times change. Today the Premier stands up and defends his advertising campaign, but in December 2005, when in Opposition, his own Minister of Finance was against doing exactly what the Premier is now doing. At that time he said that he was against putting communications ahead of doing their job properly. My question is, will the Premier admit that spending $160,000 on an ad campaign only proves that he is now putting communications ahead of doing his job properly?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : No, Mr. Speaker. In fact, every government has budgets that are designed to market the opportunities that are available in their province. In this particular instance, this is the delivery of information to people who will be taking part in the largest economic opportunity in a generation in this province. It is important that we use all avenues to get that information out to them so they can take best advantage of it. In fact, what we know already is that employers around the province are trying to figure out where they're going to get the skilled tradesmen that they're going to need in order to fill their place in the supply chain. This is important for employers, it's important for young people and it's important for the province.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : My question is for the Premier, Mr. Speaker. The impact of diabetes on our health care system will not be going away anytime soon, with 77,000 Nova Scotians impacted by the disease and 500 new cases added each month. Both prevention and management of the disease are required. Four years ago the Government of Saskatchewan initiated an insulin pump program for children under the age of 18, and just last week they expanded that program to cover people up to the age of 25. My question to the Premier, if the insulin pump program has been so successful in Saskatchewan why is your government not willing to introduce one?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Of course there are some, not only competing opinions about the best way to manage diabetes, but there are competing opinions about what the best use of the health care dollar is in terms of being the most effective management of that disease. What we are doing is working with the district health authorities to ensure that that money is being maximized and therefore that the maximum benefit is being received by those who suffer with diabetes.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in addition to the expansion of the insulin pump program in Saskatchewan their government also moved the drug Lantus, a long-lasting insulin, to full formulary listing. This means the medical criteria is no longer required in Saskatchewan in order to have Lantus covered. In Nova Scotia we can't even get the government to list Lantus as an exceptional drug, let alone make it available on the formulary. So my question to the Premier, why are other provinces so advanced when it comes to addressing the needs of diabetics in their provinces and we are content to lag behind?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, through you to the minister, I want to tell her that Alberta and Atlantic Canada are the only provinces at the present time that do not have Lantus on the formulary. We are aware that the drug, Plavix, which is not used to treat diabetics, will be moving, in January, to a generic form of that particular drug which will save the province somewhere in and around $3 million. With that saving, with the idea that we know the minister is having her meetings more recently with the front line health care workers trying to deal with Nova Scotians with diabetes, I want to ask the Premier, through you, can Nova Scotians expect to see his government not only move on this drug, but to show some clear signal that we're prepared to invest in insulin pumps to help improve Nova Scotians treat this disease?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as you would know, of course, the departments are well aware of the way in which the drugs move into the generic status and the savings that would come from that. Those are already accounted for in the health care budgets in advance of the transition taking place. It's not actually a saving; it is a calculated reduction in the expense that is picked up elsewhere in the health care budget. We are constantly looking at ways to be able to improve the delivery of service to people in the province, whether it's through new technology, through new drugs that are coming on the market - these are things we are constantly monitoring - of course, we have the very difficult job of doing that within a fixed budget.</p>

There are rural communities such as Yarmouth and towns in the Valley that have been experiencing shortage of physician services which is impacting emergency care and consistent primary care. These residents are waiting for the outcome of this report. However, if past experience of the minister is any indication of future behaviour, there will be considerable lapse of time before the public is informed of the contents of the report and what steps are next in the process.

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. As part of the deal that Cabinet put together with Bowater, Nova Scotia Power has added a load-shifting credit of $0.5 million per year. Would the Premier please explain to the House how this portion of the agreement will work, how it might affect other ratepayers in the province, and what amount of energy Bowater would be entitled to?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : The way it works is that a credit is given to Bowater for using power at points of time in the day when the demand goes down. As the member opposite would know, the ability of the power company to supply power works at a certain peak level, when it cycles down and up that actually causes increased costs in the overall running of the utility. Because Bowater will pick up the slack and operate at times when the utility is going through a slacker time for the call on the electricity that's being generated, they will be given credit for shifting their work cycle in order to match the ability of the utility to provide the load at that period.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Premier's clarification because it is slightly different from what the department has been saying. Another part of the deal would actually have Brooklyn Energy, which is of course one of the companies associated, access or supply additional energy and we've been told by the Department of Energy that that will come in through the Community Feed-in Tariff Program which is why it was not part of the legislation. The only concern with that, or one of the concerns with that, of course, is there are actually only 3.3 megawatts of energy available, or space available, according to Nova Scotia Power, in that area to tap in, which means that any energy that Brooklyn Energy now puts on there will shut out other renewable energy suppliers in the area.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, just to be clear for the member opposite, that's different than load shifting, that's a different component of what takes place. This is about putting in place an additional piece of technology, the topping turbine, which will essentially use the steam that's already being created but is now currently way steam. So this creates green energy which will be sold into the grid at the COMFIT rate. We're told that there is enough capacity to ensure that that comes on and is part of the overall green energy makeup of the grid and, frankly, Mr. Speaker, this should be a good thing. If it's a good thing for Bowater, it will be a good thing for Nova Scotia and, of course, it's a good thing for the province.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I think the Premier is maybe misunderstanding the concern. It's not the fact that there's a problem with green energy or the topping turbine, or anything else. The problem is that there are renewable energy suppliers that are going to create jobs in the Queens County area that now, according to Nova Scotia Power and the Department of Energy, will be shut out because the energy access that they would have used will now be used up by Brooklyn Energy. There's a finite amount of power, or a finite space available.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what the member opposite should have said is that that's his understanding of what was said by Nova Scotia Power and the URB, and whoever else he was talking to, but that's not the case. In fact, those people who are currently in the queue who are looking to become contributors to the green energy makeup in the province will still have the opportunity to access that through the COMFIT Program.

          <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, my question through you today is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. Nova Scotia, as you know, is one of the few provinces in Canada that doesn't offer any funding for insulin pumps and in November, I think a lot of members of this House of Assembly attended a dinner with the Canadian Diabetes Association. They released a report that shows a provincial investment in a publicly-funded insulin pump program could improve health outcomes for Nova Scotians with diabetes and save the province up to $1.4 million by 2032. I will table that release as soon as I can pull it out of my book here.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, we currently have programs to assist people with diabetes in Nova Scotia. We spend approximately $19 million annually to assist people. There are four other provinces that have insulin pump programs for some portion of their diabetic population; there are two provinces that have announced they will implement programs, and we have yet to see the details of what those programs look like.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : In November the Canadian Diabetes Association forecast a 44 per cent rise in diabetes in Nova Scotia over the next 10 years. The association estimated that the direct and indirect financial impacts of diabetes in Nova Scotia currently cost the province $383 million per year. By 2020 the association believes that these costs will increase to nearly half a billion dollars if action is not taken. A public insulin pump program could save the province money - $1.4 million by 2032, according to the association. So why won't the minister act now to control the economic cost to the province and soften the human cost associated with diabetes?</p>

          <from>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as the honourable member no doubt knows, insulin pumps are probably the most expensive form of treatment that we could look at. A pump can cost $5,000 to $6,000, and the supplies can be approximately $400 a month. The life of an insulin pump is limited, so they need replacement every five years or so. It's a very, very costly form of intervention.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : We do understand the cost associated with an insulin pump. Insulin pumps sometimes cost between $4,000 and $7,000, depending on the model that you're getting - a figure that is, of course, out of reach by many Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, the member is correct, insulin pumps aren't for every person with diabetes or, indeed, for every child with diabetes. The physicians at the IWK, for example, have access to a fund called the Emily Fund, which is specifically a fund that assists families for whom an insulin pump would be a benefit, but are unable to acquire because they don't have private insurance - so quite often children are able to access these pumps through that program.</p>

This program is advertised in the paper, it's advertised at food banks - as a matter of fact I think the department actually sends out to people who previously subscribed to the program, so people in other years who have used the program, the information is sent to them and, as well, is sent to all the MLA offices.</p>

I think there are over 100 agencies in this province that get this information. I have to say, as minister for the department, this is not one - even as an MLA - that I actually say that I've encountered, that this is a problem for people to get this information. It seems to get out there and be well used.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, in one particular case constituents approached various wood-pellet stove dealers to ask about the availability of a rebate. None of these dealers were aware of any rebates so these people were then sent to Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations. It took them many phone calls to find the proper person, through Access Nova Scotia, and even then the person they spoke to was unclear of how to qualify for the rebate and even uncertain what specific rebate to suggest. This is a problem. When Access Nova Scotia representatives are unclear about programs and rebates, it makes it that much more difficult for Nova Scotians to be able to navigate through the system. What is the minister going to do in order to improve and streamline the system so that Nova Scotians will be able to navigate through an often bewildering process to qualify and obtain rebates that they're entitled to?</p>

My question to the short-on-details minister is, why won't the minister finally admit that on Monday, when he announced about the Telus World Skins Games, he did not know how taxpayers' money was going to be used and that he continues to make ad hoc funding decisions with borrowed money?</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. This Friday the rehabilitation pool located in the rehab centre on Summer Street will cease to operate. In-patients of the rehab who have enjoyed the immense health benefits associated with therapeutic hydrotherapy will either have to be transported outside the centre to another community facility or go without. The reason for the disruption in service? Budget constraints imposed by the province.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The closure of that particular facility has nothing to do with budget constraints. The pool at the rehab centre is quite old, and they've had many problems with it over the last year or so, to the extent that there have been leaks on floors below where that pool is located. The Capital District Health Authority has decided, in the interest of patient safety and the functioning of the rehab centre as a whole, that it is best that that particular facility be closed. They are moving forward with that plan.</p>

We knew that we could get a better deal for the taxpayers and we also knew that we were able to deliver high-quality services. So we put the home oxygen programs out to tender.

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Certainly the Shubenacadie Canal is a truly wonderful engineering facility here in our province. I know the honourable member has had a close personal relationship with it; I congratulate him on his book that he has recently published on the canal. It's a facility that this government supports; in fact, we have annual operating grant, I think it's around $32,100, and we appoint members to the commission and, again, it's just a real asset for the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Well, you know, Mr. Speaker, both this minister and the previous minister have said in questioning, in very similar questions over the past few years, that they support the work of the commission, which we obviously all appreciate since they are required by an Act of the Legislature to do that. Their total funding has decreased since the NDP took power, of course, much like other things. But one of the questions that I've asked this minister and the previous minister is about appointments to the commission, which the Executive Council is responsible to. There are now 12 positions on the board and seven of them remain vacant, two and a half years later. I asked two years ago, I asked last year, and they're still vacant. Can the minister tell us when he finally plans to make those appointments to the Shubenacadie Canal Commission?</p>

          <p>MR.

As far as the commission members, we've recently appointed one new member; there are two others in process that are going through, so that will be another three additional members that will now be there. We're always looking for good candidates to serve on the Shubenacadie Canal Commission and if that honourable member or any others have suggestions, we would certainly welcome those to come forward.</p>

Many of the people who have applied, and haven't even received acknowledgement, have contacted other members of the Legislature.</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Minister of Natural Resources. In mid-November I was part of a delegation to Ottawa that met with the federal Minister of State for Transportation, regarding the MV Miner, which is on the shores of Scatarie Island. The Premier was on that trip, as well as the member for Glace Bay.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, certainly the Scatarie Island area is an important wilderness protection area in our province and we know that around that island there is an important fishery of scallops and lobsters and other species. We're trying to do everything we can to protect it. We've had ongoing meetings with our federal counterparts. As you know, the province spent somewhere in the vicinity of $300,000-plus for an environmental cleanup and to get any dangerous goods off the ship.</p>

MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, there's been a lot of talk about what was and what wasn't going to happen around the site, to ensure that the MV Miner was not damaging the health and safety of people or the local sea life. Early this week there were reports of oil leaking from the engines. Now I've been out to the ship and there was a large hole in its hull at that time and it's gotten worse. Winter is fast approaching and I don't know if the ship will survive another storm. It's falling apart. On October 7th, Mr. Speaker, the Premier committed to make sure the ship is quickly removed, to avoid environmental damage.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, after intense pressure from the Liberal caucus and from Nova Scotians across the province, the government made a commitment that they would not venture any further into the world of on-line gambling. With ALC expanding to markets across the globe and to jurisdictions with very different laws and regulations on gambling, Nova Scotians have good reason to be concerned with the possibility that they may be moving away from that position. Has the minister made it clear to ALC that regardless of what markets they enter, Nova Scotia will not allow any proposals for on-line gambling expansion?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I think the government has been very clear on where we want to see gaming go in Nova Scotia. We announced our Gaming Strategy earlier this year and we really put that Gaming Strategy together with a lens of responsible gaming. We were the first jurisdiction in North America, if not in the world, to include in our Gaming Strategy a responsible gaming tool for VLTs in our province. That's a first of any jurisdiction, and I think that's a commitment that Nova Scotians can recognize that the government's taking seriously some of the reductions or harm-reduction tools that we will put into place here in Nova Scotia for those individuals who choose to use gaming as an avenue of their entertainment.</p>

We are proud of the consultation that we received. I'm a little perplexed about the Liberal Party's interest in responsible gaming - during that consultation we asked both Parties for their input, and I have to acknowledge the Progressive Conservative Party forwarded some concerns that they have, but the Liberal Party chose not to take part in that consultation.

The problem was that one was a sustainable service, one that's going to lead to greater economic development in the area, and the other one had a diminishing return. Unfortunately it was not meeting the objectives that would create more employment in the area and so we came to the regrettable decision that that $6 million a year, that was growing every year to more money, would be better used as an investment in economic development in the region.</p>

Tourism operators across the province have screamed their outrage on this and told the Premier how it has impacted their business. Again we have, this session of the Legislature, the Premier willing to give between $50 and $90 million to Bowater, the reason being to support the economy of the South Shore. All we're asking on this side is why that same logic - investing in important pieces of infrastructure, investing in business, investing in economic engines - wasn't applied when it came to the Yarmouth ferry, and why the Premier doesn't currently apply it right now?</p>

          <p>MR. JIM BOUDREAU : Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is my pleasure to rise today to speak about the investments our NDP Government has made to grow the economy of Cape Breton. My constituency of Guysborough-Sheet Harbour borders the Canso Causeway, which is the gateway to the island. We share a border, if you will, and we also share many of the same goals and aspirations.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Madam Speaker, I stand here and listen to some of the so-called trophies for the NDP Government on the other side that were initially started by Opposition governments. He talks about the Central Nova Scotia Railway that the member who preceded me in Cape Breton North fought so hard to keep. He talks about the Sydney tar ponds. If he could find his way to the tar ponds, he'd realize that that tar ponds project was started years and years before this NDP Government was in power. It was under a Tory Government and it's federally-provincially sponsored, so to quit that would be suicide for people in Cape Breton.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, I'd like to offer a few comments on Resolution No. 2778. I'll start by saying that this discussion today is a reality check on what is really happening in Cape Breton, and that's why the resolution is here: 15.7 per cent unemployment in Cape Breton is simply not acceptable. It's half that unemployment rate in Halifax. Cape Breton, the last time I looked, was still a part of Nova Scotia, and should be treated equally as all other areas of rural Nova Scotia should be treated.</p>
