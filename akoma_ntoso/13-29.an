          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, those jobs must be somewhere else in Daewoo's operation, because they're sure not here in Nova Scotia. In 2010, the Premier told Nova Scotians this $60 million would result in 500 new jobs at this plant. In fact, the Premier insisted that DSTN would produce between 200 and 250 wind turbines per year. Since that time, we've seen DSTN has produced only 20 turbines, and all we have seen in employment have been layoffs instead of job growth. The wind business is unfolding so poorly that DSTN is now expanding into Halifax and away from wind, into oil and gas, heavy industrial fabrication, and shipbuilding. DSTN will now be competing with companies that aren't subsidized by taxpayers to the tune of $60 million.</p>

That's the Liberal Party. Nobody could have been responsible for more corporate welfare anywhere in this country than the Liberal Party. They did it consistently with the federal government; they did it here in the Province of Nova Scotia time and time and time again. We are investing in real jobs.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Conference Board of Canada actually studied 46 mid-sized municipalities across Canada, and one of them, very interestingly, was the New Glasgow area. They reported, and I will table this for the Premier, the Conference Board says that New Glasgow's economy shrank every year since 2009. I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier. Glad to hear he's investing in jobs somewhere, but it's not in the New Glasgow area. Meanwhile, the same report says that across the Northumberland Strait, the economy of Charlottetown has grown in real terms every year from 2005 to 2012. Even Summerside has expanded every year. But in the case of New Glasgow and area, their economy has shrunk every year since 2009.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yes, Halifax is growing. I guess that's why the Premier gave the Irvings all that money to build a parking garage down on the waterfront here, but the question was about New Glasgow. (Interruptions) We'd certainly support investments that actually created jobs, but the Conference Board report clearly says that in the New Glasgow area, "the region has shed almost 6,000 jobs since 2008." That's a pretty poor investment when you manage to lose 6,000 jobs in exchange for all that money.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, 60 million tax dollars went to DSTN with the promise of 250 turbines per year and 500 jobs. Three years later, this promise has failed to materialize. A recent Conference Board of Canada study points out that since 2009, New Glasgow's economy shrank every year and the region shed 6,000 jobs. In fact, things are so unimpressive at DSTN that they had to look to other industries in order to stay afloat. It's easy to stay afloat when you're using tax dollars to subsidize your operations. Every entrepreneur in Nova Scotia would certainly like that opportunity.</p>

In fact, DSTN is expanding into oil and gas, heavy industrial fabrication and shipbuilding. This means they will be competing with businesses that have not received a $60 million subsidy from the government, yet again the minister is using taxpayer dollars to go head to head with Nova Scotia businesses for contracts.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the contract calls for the people of Nova Scotia to receive stable energy rates for the entire period of the contract. This means that Nova Scotians will get the lowest, fairest rates available from that project. It will be a stable energy price. It will be an economic development bonus for Nova Scotia. We will be able to attract more employment and more jobs into the area.</p>

All of the information tabled before the board at the moment shows that the rates would be cheaper. In fact, the Energy Minister himself said the other day that it would be cheaper if we went with a made-in-Nova Scotia solution, and I'll table that. So let's go to that.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I really think that the member for Dartmouth East believes that he can get away with simply distorting everything he says, and that somehow people in Nova Scotia will believe it. What he is referring to - the 7.5 per cent - is about Pubnico Point. Pubnico Point is now one of the cheaper conveyors of energy in the province, but when it was built, it was 3.5 cents more expensive. The advantage of Pubnico Point, of course - which is the exact advantage of the Maritime Link and the exact advantage of new wind that comes on - is that it is stable over the long term, and that it provides cheaper rates over the long term. So unwittingly, which is an apt description, unwittingly the member for Dartmouth East has just proven the exact point, why the investments should be made in infrastructure like the Maritime Link.</p>

Cape Breton's unemployment in 2012 was about the same as it was in the mid-2000s. Truro avoided significant decline during the recession but economic growth was modest between 2005 and 2012. The NDP have left rural Nova Scotia to crumble. We see our young people moving away and the ones who remain are largely unemployed.

First of all, I want to tell you that with fracking, we understand the concerns of Nova Scotians and that's why we are in the process of conducting a thorough review which will be completed in 2014.

We know that fracking waste water has been imported for treatment from New Brunswick, possibly other places, at least 10 million litres so far - maybe more but 10 million that is known of - there's a lot of talk about the economy today, it seems the NDP want an economy based on hazardous waste treatment in Nova Scotia, I guess.</p>

I want to make that very clear today in this House - they are not being served TV dinners. That's why the district health authority, when they made recent changes, they went out into the community, they asked for input from the community. They had people from the Legion, concerned siblings and children of veterans who were actually living at the facility, to see what they could do to improve conditions. Out of that were recommendations that the district health authority has accepted and they will implement all those recommendations from a group of individuals, from all sides, who were concerned with the food of the veterans.

          <from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from>
          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, years of tumultuous negotiations under the former Progressive Conservative Government have left paramedics in this province frustrated. Two years after the most current agreement between paramedics and EMC has expired, this ugly history could very well repeat itself. The paramedics we have heard from are angry, and this anger is shared equally amongst all parties involved in the negotiating process, including government. The first contract was rejected by a vote of 98 per cent, and many paramedics are telling us the new contract being voted on right now is not much different than the previous contract rejected.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I know both sides have worked extremely hard to try to come to an agreement that can be ratified by the paramedics. I'm not going to negotiate any contract on the floor of the Legislature. I believe in collective bargaining. We've said that so many times here in the Legislature. I think there's a process in place for them to try to resolve and come to an agreement, and I look forward to the paramedics and EMC doing that.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, from what I understand, the voting isn't taking place today. They were working on trying to get a handle on that. We have a large province. I know the union themselves need to facilitate that, and I am confident that both sides will be able to work through this. That's why we have collective bargaining. That's why there is a process in place and I look forward to that process coming to, I think, a positive ending. I look forward to continuing to support our men and women who are paramedics across this province, in whatever environment they choose to work in.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the original promise of high-speed Internet for all Nova Scotians was to be completed by 2010. At the present time, there are still hundreds in the southwestern part of the province who do not have high-speed access - in fact, a couple of hundred in the member for Digby-Annapolis' riding alone. Access to high-speed Internet is an important service. Really, it's a rural and economic development issue, and here we are, over three years later, with hundreds of Nova Scotians without access.</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question - a very important one. My first response to the member opposite is, first of all, when it comes to broadband, it was a project that was underestimated, in my opinion.

Eastlink currently has that project in place where they are providing high-speed access direct from satellite to home, and the project is proving to be very successful. However, in order to be able to fully embrace this technology, government needs to change the original contract. This will allow them greater flexibility to ensure that all Nova Scotians will have access to high-speed Internet service.</p>

          <from>MR. KEITH BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, the renowned Cabot Trail is noted throughout the world for its beauty and its people. Over the past number of years, reconstruction of the Victoria County portion of the Cabot Trail has taken place - reconstruction, I must note, that was started by the PC Government in 2007. My question to the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal is, does his department plan on paving a portion of the Victoria County section of the Cabot Trail this year?</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Without getting into an argument with the member for Inverness on who deserves it more we'll just move on. Mr. Speaker, the 2012-13 five-year capital plan said that a section of the Cabot Trail in Victoria County from Little River southerly for 6.3 kilometres would be done. In the 2013-14 five-year plan it's not there. The government has been trumpeting the five-year plan so the people will know the projects that are taking place. My question for the minister would be why was that section in the 2012-13 five-year plan but not in the 2013-14 five-year plan?</p>

          <p>MR. SMITH : Again, it's an important question because I understand that he is concerned about his constituents and what they're looking forward to having. That portion of the road that he's talking about will be done next year. The reason - and I should tell the member so that they'll know this, this isn't just one layer of preservation pavement, this is a total reconstruction of that road and it's very, very expensive to do that kind of work.</p>

          <from>MR. BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is trying to get an argument going between the member for Inverness and myself. But I have to say that I appreciate what the minister has said about the additional paving that was done in Bay St. Lawrence and the White Point area, 27 kilometres to be exact, and it's very much appreciated by the people that live there. But we also have to keep in mind that those same people who live North of Smokey travel that road, most people every day of the week, to get to Englishtown ferry if they have a doctor's appointment in Baddeck, or whatever the case might be. I still can't understand why it went from being in the plan one year to it not being in it the next, so what good does the five-year capital plan actually do for those that want to know what's going to be taking place?</p>

          <from>MR. SMITH</from>
          <p>MR. SMITH : The five-year plan is a plan that we put forward, this year was our fourth edition. Last year we got 97 per cent of the work done that we intended to do; I can't indicate more than that. It is a plan, and sometimes when you have plans you make some alternative changes. It's not as if we've taken this off the list or told the people in that area that we're not going to get the work done, Mr. Speaker - that work will get done. As I said, for me I looked at going forward, it was time that another area other than Victoria County got some attention and I decided on Inverness. I like Cape Breton, I like the Cabot Trail, work is being done on the Cabot Trail. We can't do it all in one year. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : See, Mr. Speaker, this is the problem. While the minister can list off a bunch of commitments and so-called investments, he can't point to one single economic piece of data that would indicate that his plan is actually working for Nova Scotians. If you look at the number, if you look at the actual data since this government took over in 2009, there has been a 6 per cent increase in unemployment for southwestern Nova Scotia alone. Currently in that region there are 7,400 people who are unemployed.</p>

Regan attends Fanning Education Centre and recently she was working on a project for the Heritage Fair and as she reported: "When I was researching my Heritage Fair Project on Provincial Shields I found an important piece of information that I was surprised about. Nova Scotia's flag wasn't an official flag because it used the armorial banner. New Brunswick, PEI and British Columbia all use their armorial bearings for their flags - that are official. My mom and I thought we should contact our MLA, Jim Boudreau to see if it was still unofficial."</p>

I just want the member for Dartmouth East to - his comment around the enforcement. This is an aspect of the bill that the HRM said they didn't want to be involved with, and thought the province should, so there has to be something in the bill in that regard if we're going to write regulation around that. I think we've tried to not make it too prescriptive at this stage, and we do look forward - it certainly would be our intention, as the regulations are drafted, that we would do that in conjunction with HRM. We have no intention of doing this on our own. We have had a lot of back and forth on this piece of legislation to this stage.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, at the Law Amendments Committee process, when we looked at these bills, specifically Bill No. 73 and Bill No. 74, I raised concerns over the length of the names that were being proposed, because when we went through the boundary review process, the proposed name for the new riding, which includes the portion which I currently represent, had been Cape Breton-Richmond. We had discussions about whether that was an accurate reflection of the fact that you had the Town of Port Hawkesbury, the County of Richmond, and a significant portion of what is now known as Cape Breton West - the communities of Big Pond, Ben Eoin, East Bay, and other communities.</p>

          <from>HON. KEITH COLWELL</from>
          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious issue for the municipalities, in particular HRM. As the province proceeded to eliminate the MOU that was in place for the province to take over the cost of education and certain other costs that the province had in place from the municipalities, it has become obvious, even though the minister at the time indicated there would be no extra cost for municipalities . . .</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : As the minister indicated during the debate and information that followed up after the MOU was basically torn up for the municipality and indeed he continues to say there is an out clause in it - and definitely there is - it doesn't mean they had to do it. They said that there was no effect on the municipalities, there would be no extra money that they would have to pay. Well, talking to members of the regional council in the Halifax Regional Municipality, because of the increase in the assessment base in the Halifax Regional Municipality, this year the taxpayers of the regional municipality are going to have to pay another $8 million into education costs of the province.</p>

It is my pleasure to stand here this evening and take part in this debate about the MOU and the downloading on the municipalities of some educational costs. Mr. Speaker, we've had some good debate in this Legislature over the last little while around municipalities and the struggles they are facing in this day and age and under this NDP Government, and we've had a lot of talk about the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. I heard the member opposite talking about the municipalities and how they didn't raise their tax rates and the Halifax Regional Municipality actually only raised their tax rates for cleaning sidewalks.</p>
