          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, earlier this afternoon the province announced support, through a loan guarantee, for Lewis Mouldings and Wood Specialties in Weymouth. We are fortunate that several representatives of this long-standing family-owned business are in the gallery this afternoon. Jamie Lewis is the general manager and his sister, Laurie Wheatley, manages human resources and fibre fuel sales. Their father, Stewart Lewis, founded the company.</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to talk about how this government is helping businesses of all sizes create and maintain good jobs and grow our economy. One of those companies is Lewis Mouldings and Wood Specialties in southwestern Nova Scotia. They employ 75 people in Weymouth, where they manufacture white pine mouldings, baseboards, and other millwork. They also produce fibre fuel, a briquette made from wood waste that is used as an alternative to firewood.</p>

          <from>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : I would also like to thank the minister for his advance copy of his statement today. Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of our economy and it is always important to celebrate the achievements and the growth of businesses that call Nova Scotia home. As a province we are encouraged to see success in the private sector as it signals that the hard work, sacrifice, and risk is paying off for local entrepreneurs. We are fully supportive of Lewis Mouldings of Weymouth and we know that they will continue to innovate, grow, and inspire other stakeholders in the forestry sector. The guaranteeing of loans is an important tool government has to provide support to the private sector and share in that risk while recovering tax dollars when respective companies experience increasingly healthy balance sheets.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, I'd also like to thank the minister for a copy of his remarks in advance and the member for Glace Bay for his comments. I'd like to thank Mr. Jamie Lewis for being here today. Lewis Mouldings and Wood Specialties in southwest Nova Scotia is a great small business that employs 75 people in Weymouth and the surrounding areas. Our Leader has had the opportunity to tour Lewis Mouldings and meet with the people who work there. They care deeply about maintaining good jobs and protecting the way of life in rural Nova Scotia. Lewis Mouldings is a great example of a third-generation business with deep roots in the community and a leader in the eastern white pine value-added industry, but Lewis Mouldings is just one of the many businesses that have been hit hard by the NDP's mismanagement of the economy.</p>

All are tested on that understanding by the decisions they make - but it's not clear here everybody does understand that.</p>
