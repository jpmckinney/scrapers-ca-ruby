          <from>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
          <p>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about an important agreement that impacts all Nova Scotians. My colleagues in the Legislature, the public, and the partners in the energy industry are all very interested in the government's position on the Maritime Link project. Last Friday the Utility and Review Board ruled that the project agreement will proceed and made it clear that Emera and Nalcor shareholders take on project risks, not ratepayers. This is a significant milestone and one our government helped shape by intervening at the recent hearings to ensure Nova Scotia ratepayers' interests are protected.</p>

          <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the minister for giving us a copy of his statement today. The Maritime Link is one in which the whole deal has been shrouded in secrecy with so many unanswered questions for so long that it is interesting to hear someone actually stand up and explain some of it. I commend the minister for that because we didn't necessarily get it from our friends who are sitting way off to our left here now.</p>

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for giving us this statement in advance. The minister likes to heap much praise about the deal, particularly on himself. He likes to go on and talk about the eight positions they put forward and they were all accepted. But they were soundly rejected and even in a ChronicleHerald column on Emera by Ms. Stephenson, Emera gets early Christmas gift on Maritime Link approval, the provincial regulator rejected eight conditions requested by the Nova Scotia Liberal Government. I'll table that. (Intteruption)</p>

          <p>MR. CORBETT : The member is saying, you know the costs now, but you didn't before. Well, Mr. Speaker, as we know, from time to time people will go back to the board and there will be rate applications made. That's just the reality, but they'll be stable. That's what we understand, and that's what businesses and ratepayers have been after, so we're satisfied with that.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Joining us in the east gallery today are constituents of mine, Jim and Brenda Marchand, who are up here in the city. I believe Jim said he's been here before, but this is Brenda's first visit to our Chamber. They are tremendous volunteers back home from the community of Louisdale and we're certainly pleased to see them joining us for today's proceedings. I'd ask my colleagues to give them a warm welcome to the Legislature. (Applause)</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier announced he will be making changes to taxes seniors pay in this province, yet days before the same Premier hiked 1,400 user fees by 6 per cent on top of the 2 per cent hike the Premier did only two years ago - among other things home care fees have been increased by 5.8 per cent.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, seniors this year, just as they have for a number of years now, who are on the GIS, come September will receive a full rebate of every cent that they have paid in GIS as a result of the initiative taken by this government. In addition, because of the work of the Minister of Finance and of our colleagues in the Cabinet, an additional $22 million has been invested in providing home care services directly to those people who need it. This is an improvement in the lives of seniors, one that we're very proud of and one that I would hope that the Leader of the Opposition would agree with.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, in fact, the increases in power rates are the result of decisions that were made by Liberal Governments, who shackled us to the international fossil fuel markets, and that it was the increase in the international price of coal that drove the fee increases; in fact, something that we on this side are actually trying to ensure doesn't happen in the future.</p>

You know, saying one thing prior to an election, and then doing something else. This is yet another election promise. And every Nova Scotian in this province knows what an election promise from this Premier is worth. With no tax increases, and no promised program cuts, Nova Scotians watched as this Premier hiked taxes, he has cut $65 million from education, and put social programs in jeopardy. And Nova Scotians are bracing for more of this tomorrow. The Premier doesn't have a revenue problem; he has a priority problem.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, since the Premier has taken power, the economy has stalled and communities across this province are dealing with high unemployment rates. While it may create a newspaper headline or a good photo op, handing over hundreds of millions of free money to large corporations is poor public policy.

The fact of the matter is, he has handed over $300 million of free money. Anyone with common sense will tell you that in order to grow our economy we need to diversify and grow it one job at a time.

Those are the words of the Minister of Education, who then went on to say, "I know we'd like to each have our own little school, but we do have to sometimes take a deep breath and move our children off to another school."

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the Maritime Link deal that the NDP is rushing through the URB process contains too many unknowns. As we are discovering, the NDP either don't know or won't tell Nova Scotians what this deal means for our future power rates. Small and medium-sized businesses have consistently ranked energy costs as their main concern for the last number of years and the NDP's silence on the impact of power rates is distressing. My question is, can the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism tell Nova Scotian businesses what this multi-billion dollar project will mean for their power rates, their competitiveness and their ability to remain a vital part of their communities past 2017?</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, where I'm coming from is that small businesses rank energy and power costs as their most critical costs - that's where I'm coming from, that's the question, that's what I'm asking. This minister should know how this multi-billion dollar deal is going to affect small businesses in Nova Scotia. He certainly doesn't seem to know what the deal means for small businesses, the same businesses that have cited soaring energy as their top concern for as long as this government has been in power. This minister is out of touch so my question is, why would a Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism blindly champion a multi-billion dollar deal for which he has no idea of the final impact on the Nova Scotia economy?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. The reality is that during that election campaign one of the key platform planks of the day happened to revolve around the question of stimulus spending that was coming from the federal government, from Mr. Harper. And in fact, the Progressive Conservatives of the day, you may remember had laid out a plan for about a billion and a half dollars' worth of spending, and the question that was routinely put to all of the Leaders at that time was whether or not we would maximize the investment that was put in place by the stimulus spending of the federal government. We said that we would, and we did.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : That's what the Premier says now, but it's not what he said when he was the candidate for Premier in 2009, as that CBC article shows. In fact, Mr. Speaker, when the Premier came into office Nova Scotia had a $19.7 million surplus. I have with me the message from the minister that accompanied the financial statements of the province that year, which clearly shows that - and I'll table that for the benefit of the House. It is kind of ironic that the government changed between the end of the year and when the message from the minister was signed, and of course is was signed by the new NDP Minister of Finance of the day, the member for Halifax Fairview.</p>

Now, it happened that there were revenues that came in that same year, but nobody would call that a balance, that you set a budget figure, and then miss it by almost a half a billion dollars and go around and tell people somehow your budget is balanced. You want to talk about a kind of hocus-pocus, that is Progressive Conservative hocus-pocus.</p>

The Auditor General signed on the dotted line that the Premier inherited a balanced set of books - that is not disputable. And, in fact, I was so pleased to see the Premier's second and current Minister of Finance write a letter to the editor of The Globe and Mail, which I will table, saying that Nova Scotia has had three deficit budgets in the last 10 years, and all three, of course, are the most recent three.</p>

In fact, last May the Liberal member for Richmond, now the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, criticized the NDP Government and said that this government is the only entity that has the power to take action and stand up to Nova Scotia Power.

The Premier and the NDP Government continue to boast about the Maritime Link when they can't or won't tell Nova Scotians what the price of power will be, or what impact it will have on the delivery of service. Rising power rates are forcing school boards to make tough decisions as this government continues to cut funding to education. School boards are being asked to do more with less.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that's why the Minister of Energy was at the rate hearing, to stand up for Nova Scotia ratepayers to ensure there would not be further rate increases. Part of the question was asked today how much the energy would be. Yesterday imported energy was $53 a megawatt; energy that was produced in this province was $49 a megawatt. If the Maritime Link had been in production yesterday, under the new deal negotiated by the Minister of Energy, we would have had energy costs at $42 - that's $7 cheaper than energy produced in this province and $11 cheaper than those being imported. That's a good deal for Nova Scotia ratepayers.</p>

I want to congratulate the members of the Liberal caucus who stood up to ensure that Nova Scotia ratepayers were being protected against a monopoly and you're right, we believe that utilities should look inward to find savings, instead of going to the Utility and Review Board looking for more rate increases. That's why I'm so proud of the Minister of Energy, sending his department down to ensure that we rework the Maritime Link Act to ensure that we're paying less for energy in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, every time you turn on TV Nova Scotians are watching ads about the virtues of the collaborative health centres, because we're finding out they aren't emergency centres, even though every community doesn't have one and despite the fact that ERs were closed over 17,000 hours last year. In fact, supplementary Public Accounts since fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, show that $6.3 million was transferred by the Department of Health and Wellness to Communications Nova Scotia - all of this at a time when this minister and the previous minister and the ministerial assistant and the deputy minister have stated repeatedly that we can't afford an insulin pump program.</p>

When we came into government we were left with a financial mess. We knew we had to do business differently in the Province of Nova Scotia. (Interruptions) The Progressive Conservatives left us with a financial mess. We had to do things differently. We chose a different path. We didn't choose the path of the past Liberal Government when it comes to reform in health care, the cut-and-slash approach that they took back in the 1990s.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the minister, there's a difference between informing Nova Scotians and brainwashing them with their own taxpayer dollars. The reality is that the faster an individual with uncontrolled diabetes is introduced to pump therapy, the better the patient outcomes, and the greater the savings to our health care system. For the last three years this NDP Government has spent the same amount of money it would cost to fund a comprehensive insulin pump program on self-promotion. In fact, of the $6.3 million transferred to Communications Nova Scotia, $1.8 million has been spent on advertising graphic displays so the minister has fancy backdrops and props and video production.</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, I definitely will bring that forward. I don't have the number at my fingertips, but I would like to make a correction around the Play-Talk-Learn bags, which are a resource that we send out to all of our youngest students in this province. It has interactive material, books and learning materials to have interactions. It was over three years, it was not a lunch bag, it was resource material for three years for our children, which is very interesting. We did it in-house and we worked with our department and child experts to make sure that we had the appropriate materials. When the member opposite was in the position I am she contracted that out and only provided those materials for very few children in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, that is why our Leader asked the Premier about the commitment from the Premier, especially during the election. When you hear of reviews of a strategy or possibilities, then Nova Scotians get concerned. That's why we ask these questions and that's why Nova Scotians want to hear from the new government that the proposals and the plan to introduce new long-term care facilities, which are much-needed, and replacement beds, will continue to happen.</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : I'd like to make a few corrections. We had a number of teachers in this province that retired over the last number of years and those are the numbers that she is citing. We have as many teachers in the province with fewer students than we've ever had. The numbers I will bring forward, but these numbers that keep coming up are not true numbers. We had 710 retired the same as every other situation over many years of teaching. We have the lowest teacher/student ratio ever in this province. In terms of our support, the people that support our children with needs, those numbers have not changed. I don't know where she's finding these numbers, thank you.</p>

GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to be able to say that these announcements that were made - and I know made just days, in fact, before the election call - but the department has gone through a very rigorous review of all our nursing homes across the province and they have identified the high needs of many of these homes. In fact, some of them are no longer meeting code in our province and they are on a replacement pattern for the next number of years.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer. I'm a little more encouraged but still leery, because I'm aware of the review that the department did. There is a current list of facilities across the province that are aged, that need replacement, and new demands in communities that have a void of new long-term care facilities. So finally, 61 beds were promised to the Mahone Nursing Home in Mahone Bay and scheduled also to begin in 2014.</p>

As a result of the five-part series that The ChronicleHerald did on long-term care, this has become a topic that's on the minds of many Nova Scotians, and one that will be a pressure on our government. We are taking the top 10 or 11 most-needed facilities in the province and moving as quickly as possible to have them move through land procurement, through planning, and into the first phase of construction as quickly as possible. We're going to move those en bloc.</p>

In fact, we looked very much through the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal at multi-year budgeting, as we did with a five-year road construction plan, that we felt this was a good model.

Cape Breton has suffered under the economic hardships imposed by the NDP. Power rates have increased by over 28 per cent since October 2009, and I'll table a document from Statistics Canada. Another 3 per cent increase is to go forward again this January, pushing more and more people out of our communities and our local companies out of business.</p>

Since October 2009, the population in Cape Breton has decreased by 4,700 people, and I will table that document as well. Full-time employment is stagnant. Nearly 5,000 people are leaving our island for better earning capacity, lower taxes, lower power rates, and I know we are all worried that this cycle may continue.</p>

SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I announced today as part of the legislation that was tabled as well that we will be undertaking a third-party review of looking at the tools that we have at our disposal for economic development both through our department, through Innovacorp, through Nova Scotia Business Incorporated, to be able to identify exactly how it is we can help attract business to Cape Breton and throughout the province; how can we work with our existing entrepreneurs that we have in Cape Breton; how can we continue to build, for example, on the Credit Union Small Business Financing Program, which is at capacity and has been a tremendous success story and for which our government has committed to increasing the guarantee from 75 per cent to 90 per cent. Those are some of the initiatives that we're working on and we're always open to new ideas of how we can grow the economy not only of Cape Breton but all of Nova Scotia.</p>

That is 2 per cent higher than the North Shore, 3 per cent higher than the South Shore, 4.2 per cent higher than in Annapolis, and 6.1 per cent higher than Halifax. With more people looking for work and businesses pointing to energy as a major cost, this rate increase in January will certainly have a negative impact on business in Cape Breton and across Nova Scotia.

We're going to do the same thing with energy. We cannot do what the former governments have done and shackle ourselves to fossil fuel, we need to have a diversified renewable electrical source of energy here in the Province of Nova Scotia, and the Muskrat Falls project will not only create economic wealth in the province, but it will allow us to really have control of our own destiny when it comes to energy here in Nova Scotia - something we've never had for many years, and we blame it both on the Liberals and Tories of the past.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the NDP have been fond of saying that we are turning the corner. We're certainly turning the corner. To use the Deputy Premier's term, this falls under the category "if you say it enough times, you believe it."</p>

          <p>MS. MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the minister's response. However, 53 per cent of respondents in the CFIB Business Barometer point to fuel and energy as a major cost constraint. Once again, I'll document and table document number two. These cost constraints are still their major concerns and are not waiting. They need real attention right now. Our small business owners cannot afford to hire more people due to the rising costs of energy.</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, proof that we are turning the corner is when, in the Fall, we announced PROJEX Engineering coming from Calgary to Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is when we announced that IBM was going to locate here in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is when we made those investments in companies in Cape Breton. Further proof of that is when we signed on with Muskrat Falls to create jobs and stable energy prices in the Province of Nova Scotia. Further proof of that is Nova Centre, right across the street, when we signed on along with the federal government to create more employment, to create a brighter future for all Nova Scotians. The proof is truly in the pudding.</p>

          <p>MS. MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, energy prices have increased by 28.5 per cent, from October 2009 to October 2013. May I table this document number three. These energy prices are still 30 per cent higher than four years ago. This problem is not waiting. The upcoming increase in January will add to that even more. Unfortunately, it's something that business owners have come to expect from their government.</p>

We learned today at Public Accounts Committee that parents of over 800 children in Nova Scotia give up jobs and money to be home with their children to give them a home-schooled education. We do know that the Auditor General has concerns about tracking the progress made by those students, but we also learned that there have only been two incidents in the last three years that have been cause for concern for the department to interject.</p>

But really, the purpose of an education is to become an independent learner so you don't need a teacher, so that you can learn things yourself. Because the education system in any province, including this one, is not static but ever-changing, the education system has to be looked at intensely critically at all points in time. It doesn't necessarily require experts from any particular field to come in and tell us what we need to do. Some of it, I think, is pretty obvious, and maybe even as plain as the nose on our faces.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Communications Nova Scotia, I want to thank the House Leader for the Official Opposition and the House Leader for the NDP caucus for their comments. Both having previously served in government would know the challenges that are faced with Communications Nova Scotia and government's attempts to communicate its message to Nova Scotians but certainly a message that we heard is that Nova Scotians want to see transparency as well when their tax dollars are being spent. Today we introduced legislation from my department and this is one more example of providing them with more transparency as to how exactly we are using Communications Nova Scotia and how monies are being spent.</p>

          <p>HON. RANDY DELOREY : Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 5, an Act to Ban the Importation of Hydraulic Fracturing Wastewater, be now read a second time. This bill that we bring forward is designed to prevent the importing or transportation of fracking wastewater into Nova Scotia from other jurisdictions. This legislation imposes fines of up to $10,000 per day that the Act is violated. This bill is a step forward in protecting the environment and the health of Nova Scotians. We've heard that Nova Scotians don't want hydraulic fracturing unless we know it can be done safely in our geology of Nova Scotia. That's why there is currently a moratorium in place on hydraulic fracturing activity in this province as we await the independent report from Dr. Wheeler, which we expect to receive in the Spring of 2014.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Mr. Speaker, as the NDP Environment Critic, I would like to be clear that our Party shares the concerns of Nova Scotians when it comes to hydraulic fracturing and its waste water. As the public's concern continues to grow over the process of fracking and the disposal of its waste water, these concerns are especially valid when considering the possibilities of environmental spills. This is why the NDP placed the moratorium on fracking two years ago and just last month the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities passed a resolution to support the NDP's province-wide moratorium. It's also why we secured the services of Dr. Wheeler to carry out the comprehensive, independent review of fracking that is currently taking place. I, like many Nova Scotians, am anxiously awaiting the results of that review.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : I'm pleased to rise and speak on the resolution. It has been very interesting to hear the Liberals and the NDP lecturing anyone, quite frankly, about how to manage the finances of the province. This from a government that just last year presented a budget to the people of Nova Scotia with a $27 million hole in it. This from a government that just two years ago presented a budget here in this House which had zero dollars in it for health equipment - clearly a nonsensical budget that they presented to the people of Nova Scotia with a straight face, only to have to raid the emergency fund for Health and Wellness when it turned out that, of course, somewhere in the province during the year we're going to need some new or upgraded health equipment. This from a government that has been in deficit for four years in a row and managed to run a surplus for one exact day before they plunged the province right back into deficit again. That is why, on the eve of tomorrow's budget, so many Nova Scotians are skeptical about what the NDP say now.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Twenty seconds. Well, you can say a lot in 20 seconds, but the fact is that this government has jeopardized their own credibility and their own integrity. In the words of the now-Minister of Finance when she was in Opposition, how can we trust you now? Thank you very much.</p>

One of the things, as we all know as MLAs, is that this will be one of those issues that each of us at one time or another will be asked to have a look at. Is there something that you could do to assist my mother, or my father, or actually in long-term care facility and continuing care, in particular, it can be of any age but this evening we are talking more about long-term care, the facilities available to Nova Scotians, also care in the home.
