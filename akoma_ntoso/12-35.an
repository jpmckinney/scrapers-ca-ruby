          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, this past weekend Nova Scotians exercised their democratic right and voted for municipal councillors, mayors, wardens and school board members right across the province. I want to thank all the candidates who put their names forward for consideration. Everyone here knows the time and energy needed to organize and run a campaign. It requires the support of one's family, a team of volunteers and a passion to be part of the solutions that will help improve the lives of all Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying a phrase that you probably won't hear very often in this House - I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the Premier just recently. All of us, over the last weekend in our respective communities, witnessed our community colleagues putting their names forward on ballots to be the municipal politicians or to represent us at the school board level. I want to congratulate all of those who were successful and I also want to recognize those who were not, who also put their names forward and brought ideas, brought their own vision and passion forward for their collective communities.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Thank you Mr. Speaker. I too want to thank the Premier for his remarks here today and also extend my thanks, and the thanks of the PC caucus, to all of those winners and others who ran, the 850 men and women who took time away from their family life and their professional life to put their name on a ballot to represent their hometown, village, or municipality in this great province, or school board as well. We all know that one of the highest honours that can be given to one of our fellow citizens is to be nominated, to stand for office, to represent their home community and to be elected by their peers to represent them whether it is on a town or municipal council, a school board, a district or here in this House of Assembly. It is a high honour and I know that those who were elected feel the same incredible responsibility, the same trust, the same need for dignity and thoughtfulness that all elected people should feel when they are entrusted by their fellow citizens to represent them.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course all of the investments we make are designed to ensure that there are jobs in this province. I know that the Leader of the Official Opposition opposed our investment in Irving Shipyards, which will yield 10,000 jobs for the province. He opposed our investment in Port Hawkesbury paper, where more than 300 people are working today in that mill and another 700 are working in the forestry sector as a result of that investment.</p>

I'll remind the Premier that there are 300 families in the Strait area looking for work because he had no job guarantees when he was handing over $155 million.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, down in Queens County we purchased some of the highest-quality and most ecologically-sensitive land in the province. I was surprised to hear the Leader of the Official Opposition say that if he were the Premier, not only would he not have purchased that land but that the purchase of land for the purpose of protecting the province's most sensitive ecosystems would not be a priority of the Liberal Party. It doesn't really come as a surprise to me, but it was interesting to hear him say it.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, if it wasn't for this government, 1,310 other Nova Scotians would be working today. This government's track record is abysmal. Since taking office, the province has the worst economic performance in all of Canada. Not only is our current economic performance the worst in Canada but by putting corporate welfare before the education of our children, the Premier is eroding our long-term economic prospects.</p>

So they intend to deregulate the market so they can take their hands off it. They intend to - well, they said anything less than 7 per cent would not be significant, so one assumes that means they're going to set the rate of return. They are going to cancel the energy efficiency program, and they have a Leader who in the last leadership debate said that taking the HST off of home electricity, and I'll quote, was "bad, bad public policy," so I can only assume that they intend to put that back on.

I would just say this, though - I think Nova Scotians have learned their lesson, or at least, many of them have; obviously not the members of that caucus. It was the policy of the Progressive Conservative Party that chained us to fossil fuels like coal in the past. At the time the reason that was done was because coal was relatively cheap as a fuel source. The problem of course with fossil fuels is that they are variable and they are volatile, so that the prices of them can swing wildly - in fact, just as the price of natural gas has done.</p>

I would just point out that Muskrat Falls supplies for us about 10 per cent of the total portfolio that the province will have. It will have the option to be able to buy, in addition to that 10 per cent - if it is at a cheaper price and lowers the rate for Nova Scotians, they will be able to buy the electricity that would otherwise flow through to other parts of the continent.</p>

We now know that shame rests solely on the shoulders of the Premier, the Attorney General, and members of his Cabinet.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are worried about whether they're going to have a job or not in this province. Last year alone, 8,600 full-time jobs disappeared from our province. Meanwhile this government has handed over a half a billion dollars in commitments to big corporations. My question to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism is, why does the minister think big corporations are more deserving than Nova Scotians?</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, the member is trying to put words in my mouth. I don't ever recall saying that we prefer big business over small business. As a matter of fact, it's quite the contrary. We work with all businesses - small, medium-sized and large businesses. You will find that if you did an analysis of the number of transactions that we've done since we've been in government, I bet you will find that over 80 per cent of the people we deal with are small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, I think that it wouldn't be fair to say that 80 per cent of the money spent by this government on economic development is spent on small business because $600 million of them went to six corporations. The reality is that this province has a terrible economic track record under this government. Nova Scotians are already being squeezed by this government's inaction on power rates and taxes, fee increases imposed by the NDP.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, I can guarantee that no one is celebrating the job record of this government in this province. Despite the messages and the brochures and the commercials, no one is happy about job creation in this province so let's get the facts straight. Since this government has taken office, Nova Scotia has less job security and full-time jobs are being replaced with part-time jobs at an alarming rate. However, 8,600 full-time jobs have disappeared from the province. This minister has seen fit to hand over $0.5 billion to six corporations and the result - even more jobs lost, at a total of 1,310.</p>

Pendant le processus, les acadiens &#xE0; travers de la province nous ont dit que les d&#xE9;put&#xE9;s acadiens de Clare, Richmond et Argyle ne repr&#xE9;sentent pas juste leur communaut&#xE9;, mais ils repr&#xE9;sentent la totalit&#xE9; de la communaut&#xE9; acadienne &#xE0; travers de la Nouvelle-&#xC9;cosse.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During Question Period, the Premier made comments with regards to the work of the Select Committee for selecting the boundary review commission. In his comments, the Premier seemed to indicate that by supporting a 25 per cent variance somehow the PC Party or anyone else was, in essence, working towards eliminating Acadian representation. The Premier would know, in the first two previous independent commissions, the terms of reference had a clause that said notwithstanding the 25 per cent variance, that in cases of linguistic, cultural or geographic size, that the commission may go beyond the 25 per cent.</p>

A year later when the final proposal came down, that night it wasn't as positive. Again, I think part of that was because you have a number of the options eliminated but it was a really dense plan and while there was more green space than there actually was with the DeWolfe Park plan, it didn't look like it because there was no central gathering point. The green space was dispersed; there were a lot of boardwalks, et cetera, and so that was the first thing I heard.</p>

Unfortunately, each year since the government has taken place, there has been a substantial amount of money left in the budget.
