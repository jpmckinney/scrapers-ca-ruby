          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. According to a new report out yesterday, Nova Scotia's economy grew by only 0.8 per cent in 2013. That makes us the second worst performing province in all of Canada. In fact while the rest of the country moves ahead, our province continues to lag behind.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the honourable member for the question. I had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Ivany and members of the commission today. They are pleased at the direction government is going. They are encouraged by the fact that we continue to reach out to the private sector and continue to build the plan that they laid out towards a 10-year vision and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with those members, even though the commission is no longer in existence, but all of them have a tremendous contribution to make and it's their voices over the next number of years that will continue to ensure that we move forward and grow good jobs here in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : One of the recommendations of the Ivany commission itself was that the province put its 19 goals to turn our economy around into legislation, much like we've done before with the environmental goals in the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act. Since the Ivany commission has reported, we now find out that not only has our economy flat-lined but manufacturing output is down by 2 per cent with 14 of 19 industries in outright decline, a real recession in the manufacturing economy where some of the best-paying jobs are, Mr. Speaker.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Ivany commissioners themselves felt that it would be worthwhile to enact their 19 goals to turn our economy around, much as we have done before on things as important as our environmental targets. I'll tell you, there is legislation that actually kills jobs in this province, like the budget of the Liberal Party, which adds $500 billion to our debt, which leaves our taxes high, which taxes our young graduates with the highest increase in their taxes in the history of the province.</p>

He couldn't even say if the DHA CEOs and vice-presidents would be terminated - he suggested that some of them might just get new job titles and be moved around. The most the minister could promise was "that it would be an evolving and organic kind of process."</p>

In the Liberal platform, on Page 25, in black and white, to reduce health care administration costs by $13 million in 2015-16 but we now know that the Liberal DHA amalgamation is going to result in added administrative costs, not just in the transition year but several years after that. Once again the Liberal Government is not delivering as advertised. My question to the Premier is why did he make a promise to Nova Scotians without knowing or having a plan on how to achieve it?</p>

One of the things that we know for certain is almost every wait time in this province is above the national average. One of the reasons for breaking down the walls in the health care service in this province is to ensure better access, more focus on front-line health care, and more focus on wait times. The Minister of Health and Wellness will end up delivering, not only on the commitment that we've made, but ensuring that Nova Scotians get the kind of health care services they deserve.</p>

A moment ago the Premier expressed his concern about short-term goals or short-sighted goals, I believe he said. I'll tell you what a short-sighted goal is: promising to charge Nova Scotia Power the efficiency fee before the election but then charging it right back to their customers after. That's pretty short sighted. Promising to balance the budget before the election and driving up our debt another $500 million in your first year - that's pretty short sighted. Promising to support young grads and then putting the largest tax increase in the history of the province on their backs - that is very short sighted.</p>

His actions to add another half a billion dollars to our debt this year, to jack up government spending for years to come with so little to show for it, to project another billion dollars in debt over the life of his government, no wonder they have the second lowest confidence level in all the country. When it comes to things that they say hold us back, like taxes and regulations, all the Premier offers is more study and no action and more lectures.</p>

Over the last five years, according to numbers from Statistics Canada, the number of youth and their employment has been in decline in this province, and I'll table that document. The number of people aged 15 to 65 has declined by 16,500. The number of people aged 65-plus has increased by a whopping 37,600. To make a bad situation worse, the unemployment rate for our youngest workers is sky high: females 15 to 24 have an unemployment rate of 17.7 per cent, and males of the same age have an unemployment rate of 22.1 per cent.</p>

          <p>HON.

The Department of Labour and Advanced Education is very serious about the employment of our young people, for example and that is why we have brought in a new special operating agency for apprenticeships here in this province. When we took office, our apprentices were taking a full two years longer to complete their apprenticeship programs than anywhere else in the country. We're changing that.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, I believe the reason it has taken a full two years longer for our apprentices is there are no jobs for them to gain their hours with. The Ivany report points to bold change, a drastic change that is needed to turn a major problem around. The House of Assembly has now been sitting for over a month, yet there is no movement towards enshrining the Ivany goals into law. Setting these goals in law would unite the province behind them and send a strong message that these goals are being taken seriously. My question is, why is the minister hesitant at getting goals and targets in law?</p>

They have been dealt the biggest tax increase they will likely ever see by this government with the elimination of Graduate Retention Rebate. In the last five years the level of employment for males age 25 to 54 has declined by 10,400; full-time employment has declined by 23.9 per cent for females and 10.9 per cent for males 15 to 24.

On Monday evening, graduates in our Red Room said the Graduate Retention Rebate helped them pay off debt, invest in the economy, and pay their bills.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the issue around the Graduate Retention Rebate program is that it was not doing what it intended to do, which was retain more students. There is absolutely no question there were some students in this province - they actually weren't students - some young Nova Scotians had regained employment and were receiving a tax benefit for having that job in this province.</p>

It was a tax benefit to people who had received a job and earned a job in this province. The initiative was to actually try to drive more job opportunities. We recognize that there's a difference between what the Graduate Retention Rebate program was and the investments that we have made. We've invested in reducing the interest on student loans; we've created a program, Graduate to Opportunities, in the first year - that program is in its infancy. It is our hope that because of the success of that and the combination of working with business owners to provide more opportunities that program will grow.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Mr. Speaker, my question today is to the Minister of Agriculture. An important and respected organization, the Women's Institutes of Nova Scotia, has been enriching our province for more than 100 years. This vibrant organization currently has over 700 members who contribute in excess of 100,000 volunteer hours every year. The organization recently had to inform its members that its annual operating grant of just $27,000 for the current fiscal year is being discontinued by the minister's department.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. It's a very important question. I did meet with the Women's Institutes last year. Actually, your government had decided not to fund the Women's Institutes for the $27,000. I did have the $27,000 put in place last year at the end of the year after I met with them and proceeded with that, and I've made arrangements for a little bit different structure this year, but if you'd like to ask me another question I could describe that in more detail.</p>

          <p>MS. ZANN : Mr. Speaker, the volunteer hours that these women contribute to our communities represent more than $1 million in unpaid work that are donated to the province, and their service at our homeless shelters, food banks, women's centres, and countless other community organizations is really invaluable. My question is, is the minister saying that he is going to fund $27,000 of operating grants, you're going to continue that to the Women's Institutes of Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Yes, we will, but it's going to be a little different structure this year. What I proposed to the Women's Institutes last year when I met with them was we were very interested in continuing supporting them. They do very important work in the community, a wonderful group of ladies who are very dedicated to agriculture in the province. What I suggested they may do is help us promote some of our industries - the wine industry, the agriculture industry - do some displays and offer them some promotional material to do that and work with the industry to do that. I think that would give them an opportunity to get their profile higher in the community, and also serve as a very important function for us in promoting locally-grown and produced products.</p>

          <p>MS. ZANN : Mr. Speaker, is the minister suggesting a workfare type of situation for this incredibly important organization that put so many volunteer hours into so many of our different organizations right across the province for over 100 years? I've heard through the grapevine and through speaking with them that this is indeed what you are suggesting, that in order to get any money now that they need to do some work for your department for that funding.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : No, that is not correct. We are going to fund the Women's Institutes for $27,000. We also want to work with them to help promote Nova Scotia products in the Superstores, grocery stores or whatever - the ones that they want to do. It would be totally voluntary on their part. We will provide the materials to do that, and it's going to be a working relationship between our department and the Women's Institutes, which I think is very important - a very well-respected organization, and what better group to do this and work closely with us in that regard.</p>

I'm surprised that this member has not looked at that.</p>

          <p>MR. JOHN LOHR : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Agriculture. The Department of Agriculture is taking an initiative to promote local grass-fed beef in our province. Nova Scotia is an ideal place to encourage this as forage land represents 65 per cent of the total crop land province-wide. My question is, can the minister confirm that the grass-fed beef industry is still a priority for this new government?</p>

          <p>MR. LOHR : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for that response. Many rural areas in our province are facing issues with the lack of provincially inspected meat processing facilities. Farmers are being forced to travel as far as P.E.I. because many facilities do not have space. While in Opposition, the now-Minister of Health and Wellness told reporters, "Smaller processing plants serving local markets may be the answer for the beef industry." He further pointed out that "The province is promoting local grass-fed beef, but many areas don't have the kill-floor capacity. A local beef plant is a necessary component of developing that part of the industry." I will table those comments from the now-Minister of Health and Wellness. Does the minister agree with his Cabinet colleague?</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : I thank the honourable member for that question. A very important part of the agriculture industry is processing. The unfortunate thing of it is, it has to be a Canadian Food Inspection Agency that inspects it. We have provincially inspected facilities that work very well but unfortunately, if we're going to ship outside of Nova Scotia, we need Canadian food inspection certified facilities. It's very expensive. We have to have a certain mass of product to put through the facility so that it runs on a continuous basis and unfortunately we don't have that volume at the present time in Nova Scotia.</p>

Aristospan is an injection that helps juvenile arthritis patients with their pain and their inflammation. Valeo Pharma, the company which distributes this drug in Nova Scotia and elsewhere, says the decision to take the drug off the market came from a third party manufacturer.

We have seen a lot of the land being built into subdivisions, which is not acceptable, and we are now working on a strategy to ensure that doesn't continue and ensure we can bring back into production some of the lands that have been taken out of production because of other issues and other opportunities that people have pursued.</p>

          <p>MS. PATRICIA ARAB : Mr. Speaker, my question today through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. Recently I had the opportunity to speak to a young man who approached me on behalf of himself and a few other students who are from Nova Scotia but are attending medical school outside the country. Their intent is to practice family medicine and they'd like to be back here in the province working, and want to know specifically what the province is doing to make that transition for residency easier for them to return back to us.</p>

          <p>HON. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, to my colleague, the member for Fairview-Clayton Park, one of the most important questions that has been asked in the House this session. I know it's one that the Premier and I and many others and former Ministers of Health have been very, very frustrated by when we have so many very capable medical graduates who train outside of Nova Scotia and who can't get back here for residency and to practise. It is one of the areas that I have asked the committee dealing with the recruitment and retention of doctors to take a look at. It's one that I will join B.C. at the national ministers' conference in the Fall, to change the way that the current practice operates.</p>

First of all, I just want to say that with the traffic that will be coming down Highway No. 103 and Highway No. 101, once the new ferry starts coming through, I want to underline that there are a number of deficiencies along a couple of those highways that need to be addressed.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, when we travelled down the South Shore and we took Highway No. 101 down and took Highway No. 103 back to the city, that was a particular area that was of very significant interest to both the deputy minister, Paul LaFleche and chief engineer, Bruce Fitzner. They pointed out the inherent dangers in that area, particularly when there's heavy volume using that corridor and certainly that intersection.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : You know, if I'm talking about that intersection, I should talk about the Argyle intersection as well, which is, I think, an engineering nightmare. How engineers can design something and forget about another road, and basically that's what happened in that area. I know the minister knows it well. As well, as they put a turning lane for one, they impeded themselves on the access to another. So you have people turning one way to go to Nakile Home for Special Care and you have people turning the other way to go to the high school. It needs to be redesigned once again, be addressed because there are far too many almost-accidents - thank goodness there's not accidents happening, but we've come close a whole bunch of times. I hope the department does address that when they can.</p>

It's a common theme from the government side as a critique of this position, that you can't legislate prosperity, and I do think that is so far misplaced. Nova Scotians are ready to work together to try and solve some of the problems facing this province and they expect their elected representatives to work together as well.

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Okay. Mr. Speaker, I think those are very wise words. I think of my own family. My father grew up during the Depression, and I know that has influenced his - he's very good with money. He was always very careful and it's something that I admire because when you grow up in that kind of an environment, when you don't have anything around you, and in his case - I'll try to keep this brief - in his case his father worked away for a number of years and he didn't see his father for about three years. His mother, she wanted to stay here.</p>
