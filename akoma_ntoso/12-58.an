          <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise today to present the third annual Accountability Report on Emergency Departments for Nova Scotia. The purpose of this report is to make the management of emergency health care more transparent and provide a tool for holding governments accountable to Nova Scotians. This report also gives government and the district health authorities accurate, reliable data so we can better understand the challenges facing our emergency care system.</p>

          <from>Mr. Speaker</from>
          <p>The recognition Nova Scotia is receiving and the data contained in this accountability report show that our province is on the right track but what's most important is the difference that Better Care Sooner is making to Nova Scotians and in their lives, Mr. Speaker : the senior who can get a same-day or next-day appointment with a doctor or a nurse practitioner or a physiotherapist, so that an everyday health care concern can be treated before it becomes an emergency.</p>

I would like to draw the attention of the members to the west gallery in the far seat we have two of my constituents: Joy Laking, well known artist, many of us have her works in our offices or in our homes; and her husband Jim Wyatt. I would like to welcome them to the House. As you know, Joy is well known and Joy has just been the recipient of a Queens Diamond Jubilee Award, so I'd like to congratulate Joy on that. Her husband, Jim, is a very active member of the district health authority in District 4, Colchester-East Hants, and I'd like to thank him for his contribution to our community and to ensure that you are able to hear the comments today from the minister and the Opposition, which we know directly impacts on the work you do. On behalf of all of us, welcome Joy and Jim to the House and I hope you enjoy the proceedings. (Applause)</p>

          <p>HON. LEONARD PREYRA : May I make an introduction? Joining us in the east gallery today is a remarkable family or two families. Joining us today is the family who discovered the unique 300,000,000 year old fossils of a sail-back amphibian on the Northumberland Shore, which was unveiled at the Museum of Natural History in August. I find it really cool that 300,000,000 years ago we had amphibians growing sails, perhaps ships started there. It is great that the first amphibians were growing sails, that we were doing sails 350 million years ago. (Interruptions)</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, as a result of this government's $65 million in cuts to education, class sizes are growing, educational assistant support is being eroded and these cuts are having a negative impact on every student in every classroom in our public education system. The Minister of Education has stated that Nova Scotia will face three years of cuts with the first two years that have been devastating to our system. My question to the Minister of Education is, will the minister stand up for kids, protect their education, and commit to stopping the third year of cuts?</p>

Instead of investing in our students' education, the NDP Government is handing out millions of dollars to large corporations. Parents, students, teachers and in fact all Nova Scotians, are left shaking their heads at this government's priorities.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Education, the NDP had to scramble this Fall to fix their short-sighted decision to actually remove the cap on class sizes, particularly in the early years. That last-minute decision caused great hardship for our youngest students and for parents who had to go through a disruptive change in classes well into the school year.</p>

          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, because of our changing demographics, our declining enrolment, many of our class sizes all across the province are extremely low. As I said, we have the lowest class sizes we've ever had. I don't have the numbers for this year but we did recognize that in certain areas of the province there was growth and when we recognized the growth in those areas, we went in and made sure that we fixed that. We listened to the teachers and the school boards and to parents.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the biggest challenge in public education today is a government that turns a blind eye to class sizes that are well above the previously-accepted maximum. The minister doesn't believe there's a problem. Well, tell that to the students of Spring Street Elementary in Amherst, who started the school year with 33 kids in their Grade 1 class, or tell that to the students at Sir Charles Tupper School here in Halifax, who had several classes far in excess of the previous maximum. That's the problem, and to say that it's fixed because on a one-time basis some teachers were added well into the school year, causing a complete scramble of those classes, does an injustice to those students and to the parents who want to know that they're going to get a good quality education.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I agree that the minister is confused, so let me clear up that confusion right now. If smaller class sizes are a worthy objective in our public education system and if it's as easy as the minister says it is to fix it, will she commit to make it the law of the Province of Nova Scotia that class sizes will be below the cap and institute that now so that no Nova Scotia family or student needs to go through the turmoil next September that she put them through this September?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Energy. We now have 940,000 experts who know what's wrong with our economy. They are officially now paying the highest power rates in all of Canada. Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec's report, released yesterday, shows that of 21 major North American cities, that the highest power rates are now paid right here in Halifax. I will table that for the benefit of the minister. As a result, 7,400 full-time jobs have been lost across our province, many in rural Nova Scotia which is officially now in a recession.</p>

In reality, past governments have relied too long on coal and every time you open your power bill you see that and that's why we're in the position we are because past governments have been on their duffs too long and really have done nothing about getting us off of that one source of dirty, imported coal.</p>

What's interesting is that Nova Scotia Power has changed their story and the minister might want to check his e-mail inbox to see what their latest line is because last May, when the report's previous year version was released, an executive of Nova Scotia Power said, no, don't look at the National Energy Board report which said we had the highest, that's wrong. The best report to look at on power prices is the one produced by Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec, the one that we have today. I'll just table that for the benefit of the House.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, we've had past governments who relied far too long on coal, relied on fossil fuels - a government without a vision, without a plan. This government has a plan. The first thing we did when we came to power is we took the HST off home energy, I understand the member's Party wants to put it back on. We had a renewable electricity plan in 2010 that looks at all the blessings that we have here in Nova Scotia like wind, tidal, sustainable biomass and hydroelectricity even of our own. We have a COMFIT program for community energy projects, we have large wind projects - if you drive over the Trans-Canada in Pictou County, you'll see a number of those. We have the Lower Churchill Project that will bring us stable energy prices for 35 years. We put on the HARP program for low-income Nova Scotians. We have done a lot, we have a plan and we need to get off one source of energy, we need a portfolio of energy sources, we're blessed in Nova Scotia with those.</p>

I've got to be thinking he's getting pretty close to being out of taxpayers' money so of course he needs some advice from the pros on how to do it.</p>

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, this government announced three weeks ago nearly 1,000 jobs coming to Nova Scotia - good jobs. One of those companies being IBM that is going to have a global centre here in Halifax. They could have set up anywhere in the world; they chose the Province of Nova Scotia to set up. This is enormous. They are not the only ones we are attracting. I don't know why the Liberal Party continues to knock good jobs coming to the Province of Nova Scotia and trying so hard to tarnish Nova Scotia's image, globally. I don't understand this except job terminators, Mr. Speaker, job terminators.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, what send signals about the economy and economic decisions for a province is when a minister and a Premier and a government give $11 million to a Calgary-based firm to compete in a sector, engineering consulting, that is growing right now with Nova Scotia products. On November 23rd, 2011 the Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Minister said, "What I will acknowledge is that this government. . . has a plan and we are sticking by that plan. The plan is working and, for the first time, we've built on that plan." It now it appears that the government is getting ready to throw that plan out. My question to the minister is, if the minister is so confident in his jobsHere strategy, why does he need a task force to bail out the mess he created?</p>

We've made offers for him to come over to the office and sit down with staff to explain the plan to him. He knows the plan is different because we are doing things in the best interests of Nova Scotians. We are building a Nova Scotia for the future, something that government in the past failed to do, but we are doing it, we are doing it.</p>

Certainly a few years ago the injured workers associations in Nova Scotia were getting about $20,000 a year in funding provincially, and it is now up to $100,000 with the ability to also access extra funding for specific initiatives or projects that would improve their effectiveness in terms of serving injured workers.

The Workers' Compensation Board has accepted, with their huge unfunded liability, that they are in a very difficult position.

For the people of Annapolis County and western Kings, closures become more problematic when the emergency room is closed in Middleton and the emergency room is closed in Digby as well, leaving the Valley Regional and the Yarmouth Regional, with some 225 kilometres between them, the only emergency room departments open in the Valley. These closures have been frustrating and puzzling to residents, given government's flurry of pre-Legislature sitting announcements around the centralized database that would ensure supply of physicians to cover emergency room closures.</p>

As I indicated, I had the pleasure earlier to introduce and table the emergency department accountability report and in my speech that I talked about earlier, we recognize that there are areas of the province that we were finding difficulty in continuing to reduce the closure rates of emergency departments. We have a suite of options that we are working with our partners across district health authorities, including physicians who are willing to put their name into a pool of physicians who are willing to work around the province, and we are working extremely hard to cover shifts, especially in the Leader's riding. We know there's an issue there and we're going to continue to work to minimize the number of closures of the emergency department in that region in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, comments are spreading throughout the community as to why the emergency room at Soldiers' Memorial Hospital has been closing more and more frequently, despite the centralized database and the additional physicians coming to our communities. Media reports have noted that with only seven emergency room physicians working at Valley Regional, the differential in wages between the two hospitals could draw more doctors to fill shifts at Valley Regional than at Soldiers' Memorial Hospital. While we all know that the Valley Regional needs to function, so do the hospitals that keep people from going to the regional centres in the first place. So could the minister indicate who sets the hourly rate for physicians at Soldiers' Memorial Hospital; is it the department or is it the district?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, no question, salaries and rates for physicians to cover shifts across the province is extremely important and extremely complicated but, no question, we work with and negotiate with Doctors Nova Scotia, who negotiate a fee, depending on what facility you work in across the province and will continue, I think, in that manner because I think it best serves the physicians that Doctors Nova Scotia represent, but also recognizing there is a difference of level of care from hospital to hospital and a difference in the amount of skills and education background that you need to work in certain hospitals around the province. So that's negotiated between the province and Doctors Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I can tell the minister that's a district as a result of the changes to the physician master agreement made by the previous Progressive Conservative Government four years ago. When the DHAs are faced with these budget cuts, the easy solution is to keep emergency rooms like Soldiers' Memorial Hospital closed. This government is a long way away from keeping its promise to keep emergency rooms open. In fact, things have worsened at Soldiers' Memorial Hospital since the NDP have come to power. So my question to the minister is, could the minister outline what he is going to do next to keep the ER open at Soldiers' Memorial Hospital?</p>

WILSON : Mr. Speaker, no question, I recognize the challenge and the anguish that not only the people who are providing services and trying to fill those difficult shifts to fill in that area of the province, but the anguish placed on the residents. Nobody wants to hear that their local emergency department is closing for a long weekend or even for one night. That's why we asked Dr. John Ross to go around the province, to figure out what we could do as a government, to address the emergency room closures. That's why he brought forward a plan and the plan is Better Care Sooner, where we have a multitude of items that we are working towards, to ensure that we minimize the closure rates across the province. One is the Collaborative Emergency Centres. We see that they're working extremely well, like in Parrsboro and Springhill, where we've seen a 93 to 97 per cent decrease in the closure rates in those communities.</p>

That's one of the things that we are looking at, increasing that kind of awareness, another program of that nature. As my friend also will know, we've recently introduced lowering speed zones in school areas, where children are present, so that there's a safety factor added to that as well.

This is a matter that we look at on a regular basis. We are in touch with municipalities. When they ask us to look at an area in terms of putting in a crosswalk, we do that on a regular basis.

I look forward to receiving that information and moving forward on a possible recommendation, if that's what comes out of the gathering of the information.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I notice with interest that Cystic Fibrosis Canada wrote all of the Atlantic Ministers of Health on June 1, 2012. I also note that CF Canada has posted on-line responses from three ministers, with the missing response being from the Minister of Health and Wellness of Nova Scotia. I understand that New Brunswick and P.E.I. used the testing services of the IWK, so a response from them is relatively straightforward. I note that the New Brunswick Health Minister stated that a proposal is expected to be provided by the department in the summer.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, in my first response, I recognize that this is a new service, that individuals at Cystic Fibrosis Canada want jurisdictions across Canada to implement their screening programs. That is why we are doing the proper steps to ensure that we recognize that these tests could possibly be implemented here in Nova Scotia. I will wait until I get those reports from the experts within our health care field here in Nova Scotia, and I look forward to speaking on this issue in the early new year.</p>

GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I know I don't have to tell the Minister of Health and Wellness just how important newborn screening is for not only the health and well-being of children, but also for the health care system in general. This is not a new test. The minister needs only to speak to his counterparts in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, or B.C. to learn more about the benefits.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, we are looking at opportunities within our system here in Nova Scotia and the screening program that we have. If we need to increase the number of screening tests that are provided for newborns here in Nova Scotia, we're going to do that. I realize that cystic fibrosis is something that we need to ensure that we diagnose early so that we can treat people earlier - no question, they have a longer life expectancy if they recognize or are diagnosed at an early age. It is a serious disease, so we will work early on in the new year to ensure that I have all the information in front of me and that we'll move forward as soon as we can and make any decision as quickly as we can.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, according to the Better Care Sooner plan released almost two years ago, there was a recommendation to increase the public's use of 811. Page 22 of the plan states that by increasing the usage of 811, "This will relieve pressure on emergency rooms, get people quickly to the hospital best equipped to meet their needs, and help people stay at home with their families when they really don't need emergency care." I will table this.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, we're very proud as a government to continue supporting the 811 service. I believe that Nova Scotians are well served by having access to the highly-trained professionals, the nurses who are overseeing that service. As Nova Scotians utilize the 811 service they do usually have contact almost immediately with someone on the other end. No question, because of call volumes, there are times when they have to leave their name and number, and that registered nurse returns the phone call to an individual. We've noticed a trend: as we advocate or as we promote the 811 system, we see an increase in the use of that service.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, Gary Burley recently called 811 and when he did a gentleman indicated the nurse was busy. After being left on hold for two or three minutes he hung up and tended to his ailing wife then called again. This time a lady answered and he got the same response, the nurse is busy. He never did get a chance to speak to the nurse that evening. The next day he spoke to the manager of clinical support services at McKesson, and was told that there were two or three nurses on duty so they were probably busy but she would double-check the numbers and get back to him. When the manager at McKesson did not get back to Mr. Burley he called the manager again and was told that he would have to talk to the Department of Health and Wellness to find out how many nurses were working at 811 that evening. Given the initial information provided to Mr. Burley, does the minister believe that two or three nurses manning the 811 system for the province is sufficient?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : It's unfortunate to hear this type of case. That's not the service we expect to be provided to Nova Scotians. I'm unaware of this circumstance but I can guarantee Nova Scotians that the 811 system is well run with the nurses that we having working that service for Nova Scotians. As I said, you may not, every time, speak to a nurse immediately. They do have people who will receive those calls when the nurses are busy to try to - similar to if you were in an emergency department - assess the acuity level of the question and they will get people to return those calls.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, according to a press release issued in March 2009, 15 full-time and 12 part-time nurses were to be hired with a contact centre located in Dartmouth and some nurses working throughout the province out of their own home. This is a far cry from the two or three nurses Mr. Burley was told were working; 811 has been established to keep people from going to emergency rooms or from calling 911 when there is no medical emergency. Given that Mr. Burley has never received a clear answer from anyone, could the minister please tell us, or could he table before the end of the business day, how many nurses work at 811 on any given 24-hour period for say the last month?</p>

As I am unaware of this particular case, I welcome the member opposite to give me any information that he has and rest assured that I will look into that and have my staff look into why someone was given certain information. I want Nova Scotians to know that we have highly trained nurses who are working the 811 service but I encourage them, if there is any doubt, if they think there is a serious issue going on medically, that they should call 911. That, I think, can ensure that they get access to the emergency care when and where they need it.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : My question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. As of May 22nd of this year, the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal changed the way services are being delivered to Nova Scotia taxpayers. In Hants West, for example, I now have my local Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal out of their Brooklyn base, something that has always been in place and works well, but now I also have the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal out of Chester covering another section of Hants West. Unfortunately as a result, there is a noticeable difference in how services are being provided. My question to the minister is, why has this policy changed when it worked so well for many, many years?</p>

          <from>HON. MAURICE SMITH</from>
          <p>HON. MAURICE SMITH : My understanding is that when these arrangements where changed, or the areas of service were changed, it was to accommodate a more evening of the workload for people in areas, so that it was a fairer distribution of the workload and it also had to do with a better distribution of equipment that we had available in different areas. At one point we might have had a piece of equipment covering - and I'm just going to as an example give a distance, but perhaps 10 kilometres whereas in a neighbouring area, the same kind of work, that the person was assigned 30 kilometres. So these realignments, as I understand it, were to balance out that workload so that they both would have approximately 20 kilometres of roadway to cover. That's my understanding of the situation.</p>

          <from>MR. PORTER</from>
          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, the department stipulates the changes are happening as a result of a new collective bargaining agreement between CUPE and the province. Part of the new agreement allegedly includes reducing the geographic size of work areas in some parts of the province. However, the hard-working individuals looking after the delivery of service consider the province's definition of a change as a smokescreen because all of this is done, it makes their specific coverage areas larger and, therefore, making it more difficult to get the necessary work done.</p>

I'm sorry if the member was having some difficulty with a portion of my department, with people in his local area, he didn't bring that to my attention. I certainly would have looked at it to determine what the problem was and to come up with a reasonable solution for him. I don't know in particular what kind of work he's saying has gone wanting as a result of these changes. Again, my understanding is that, in effect, these changes have actually improved service because it's a more evening out of the workload for the people, for the workers, so that they can actually have a fairer share of the workload and, similarly, equipment has been placed in areas that, again, makes its usage more effective.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, the real reason for this change is due to the government cutting funds that are sorely needed to take care of RIM work around rural Nova Scotia - and we all know that; any rural member would know that. I know that I don't have to explain to rural members in this House how important RIM funding is for getting work done, like getting potholes fixed, ditching done, guardrails put in place that are desperately needed. Since this change in May, the area of Vaughan and Leminster in Hants West are being neglected; in fact, so neglected the supervisor at the school bus garage has changed bus routes due to concerns expressed by area residents for the coming winter season.</p>

          <p>MR. GARY RAMEY : Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to rise to speak on Resolution No. 2275, even though I must say I can't agree with its premise, nor the kind of thinking that may have generated it in the first place. I guess the person who submitted it, or the member who submitted it, was the member for Kings West. He's a teacher, so I guess he probably understands the value of repetition when you're trying to teach somebody something, and so I'm going to repeat some things I said the other day.</p>

          <p>MR. RAMEY : Madam Speaker, I stand corrected. The Deputy Premier has written to the federal Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, and Denis Lebel and officials have started the necessary discussions. This is part of our effort to gain federal support and, we hope, investment in the new model for a Yarmouth ferry service. Currently our government has put - and I think the member for Yarmouth mentioned it - $21 million on the table for the next seven years, as our contribution to help make this happen.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : It's my pleasure to stand and speak to this resolution. I quite enjoy the partisanship sometimes in this House in listening to the member making sure that he stuck to his speaking notes. I know there was some member for Lunenburg West in that, I know there was. There were also some lines that, of course, were presented to him from the caucus office as from central government. But what he didn't really speak about all throughout that was really the truly Yarmouth issue, which is the cancellation of the ferry by that government.</p>
