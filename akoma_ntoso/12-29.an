          <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I rise in my place today to inform the House that our government has approved the business plans for the nine district health authorities and the IWK for 2012-13. This is the first time ever that district health authority budget plans have been approved this early in the fiscal year. It's a commitment we made to ensure better management of our health care system, and stands in sharp contrast to previous governments that sometimes didn't even approve business plans until almost a full fiscal year had passed.</p>

          <from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from>
          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for the advance copy of her ministerial statement. I do believe that it's a positive development that business plans were approved as soon as possible, and I agree it's helpful for the DHAs to have a full year to implement the plan, however damaging the plan may be. It is unfortunate, however, that these plans do not become part of the budget debate process so that all Nova Scotians can see the impact health care cuts will have on the delivery of health care.</p>

I had the opportunity to meet Douglas this past weekend in the great community of Whitney Pier, where Douglas was part of a Polish dance group that performed at the Polish Hall in commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the Saint Michael's Polish Association and Benefit Society, for which, of course, we passed recent amendments to their legislation. It was the first piece of legislation that was in English and in Polish.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, earlier today we learned that the president of Emera made a 7 per cent increase to his total compensation, which is equal to almost $3 million per year. The president of Nova Scotia Power has had a 23 per cent increase in his total compensation package, bringing it to $1.15 million.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out to the Leader of the Official Opposition in the past, executive bonuses and incentives to senior executives of Nova Scotia Power are not part of the rate application, nor will they be part of the basis on which rates are decided.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, their salaries are - and I know the Premier would know - and so are the executive bonuses. They were only excluded for one year, and that was last year. The Premier knows that. The Nova Scotia Power president's compensation is $1.15 million a year; a 23 per cent increase. At the same time, this company is going before the URB for consecutive increases - a 20 per cent increase since they've taken power. Nova Scotians are struggling to meet their power bills, and at the same time they find out that the executives of this company are making millions of dollars. Ironically, that's only one executive. It would be helpful if this company would disclose the entire compensation package that Nova Scotia Power is receiving for all of their executives.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I have said before that audits of the utility have already been completed. This morning on one of the popular radio shows, they interviewed the consumer advocate who represents consumers at the Utility and Review Board. They actually asked the exact question that the Leader of the Official Opposition - in fact, they referred to the Leader of the Official Opposition's question - and the consumer advocate said that there had been a lot of audits done of the utility, that that was not the issue. What was required at the Utility and Review Board was a diligence with respect to the examination of the rate filings, which is why the consumer advocate was created, of course. It is why the government is there: to oversee the rate applications, to ensure that the rates that are decided are fair and that they take into account only the appropriate expenses.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, what the consumer advocate said was that aspects of the rate filing go under audit each and every time. There has not been a total performance value audit done of Nova Scotia Power in a number of years. I said yesterday that Nova Scotia Power executives have a responsibility to the shareholders, and they do their job very well, but the people in this House and the Premier of this province have a responsibility to ratepayers and he's not doing his job.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, we now know that the Halifax Regional School Board has been forced to deal with a $10.2 million budget shortfall because of cuts imposed on them by the NDP. The Premier told all Nova Scotians that cuts were enrolment-based. In fact, we know that the Halifax Regional School Board is going to lose 154 teachers, as a result of their cuts. Only 25 of those teachers are losing their jobs because of enrolment-based decline. All the rest, other than those 25, are the result of cuts beyond enrolment-based cuts.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, they are enrolment-based. Of course the figures that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party refers to and that the board referred to is over a year. In fact, the decline in Nova Scotia and in this board - although as the board chair has pointed out, is not as pronounced in Halifax as in other parts of the municipality - has in fact been going on for a number of years. That is why I assume that the board chose to find savings in the manner in which they decided to find them.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, if the Premier believes that answer, he should have ran for chair of the school board and not for Premier of all Nova Scotia because the fact remains that 25 teachers are enrolment-related, but 154 teachers in total are being cut, because of decisions made by his government.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I understand why it is that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is asking the question, although I believe that he is not properly representing the reality of it. The reality is that we have historic lows in class sizes in the province that will continue to be the case. That will continue to be the case in the Halifax Regional School Board.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, what is upsetting to people is when they have a Premier who tells them the cuts are only enrolment-related when they're not, and they have a Premier who tells them that they won't affect the classroom when they do. That is what is upsetting to the students and the parents of Halifax Regional School Board.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I had pointed out, there are very significant declines. There was a review done of the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board by Mr. Stewart. That was released and it demonstrated that even though the number of students in that board had decreased by something like 2,225, I believe, or 2,250, the number of teachers in the system had only gone down by 10 and that, in fact, the number of hours that had been allocated for teachers' assistants in the classroom had actually gone up by something like 146 hours, I believe was the figure.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Official Opposition should know that there is the Utility and Review Board process. It is one that is designed to take into account the requirements that the utility has in order to be able to fulfill its mandate, in order to be able to supply electricity to the people of Nova Scotia. That is a job that is fulfilled by the board based on the evidence that comes before it. Surely, the Leader of the Official Opposition is not suggesting that for political reasons, the Premier of the province ought to be involved in that process.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : My question is for the Premier. Last week at the Public Accounts Committee I asked the chair of the Utility and Review Board whether or not a change in legislation would be needed to ensure the Premier's commitment that the URB fully review the Maritime Link project can be met. The chair said that he felt legislation would be needed unless it became an NSP project, and even in that case they would only review part of the project, and I'll table that.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Even the department's deputy minister said that you were wrong yesterday and said they wouldn't be able to review the portions of the project outside of Nova Scotia under any legislation currently. All we're asking is for the Premier to admit that he made a mistake and he didn't check the facts before he spoke, and frankly, everybody makes mistakes. I'm sure Nova Scotians would appreciate it if the Premier would just simply say he made a mistake, they are correcting it introducing the legislation, and we move on. So, Mr. Speaker, will the Premier please admit that he was mistaken when he said legislation wasn't necessary for a complete review of the project?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course, as I've pointed out, that's not what the chair of the board said so I'll quote from the actual Hansard. It says, "I hope and expect that we'll be given our normal mandate under Section 35 of the Public Utilities Act to make whatever inquiry we think we need to make . . ." Mr. Gurnham said. I'll give this back to them so that perhaps the member opposite can read it.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : What the Premier forgot to say in that quote was that that was a part of the answer to the question but also said that would only apply if Nova Scotia Power made the application and it would still not allow a review for the part of the project outside of Nova Scotia. Mr. Speaker - and the Deputy Minister of Energy said this yesterday - the difference with the legislation that was introduced yesterday is that this will allow the URB, if Cabinet decides to review the parts of the project that are outside of Nova Scotia and allow a review of the project if it is not submitted by Nova Scotia Power, which is an entirely different issue. The legislation introduced yesterday addresses an issue that the Public Utilities Act doesn't cover. So the Premier is going to have to make regulations on this and decide what the Utility and Review Board should review, related to the Muskrat Falls project.</p>

He said, "Coal is dirty and expensive and getting more expensive and electricity prices continue to climb in my region as a result - which is a hardship for our industrial base and manufacturing . . .

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, for the first time in umpteen Question Periods, the Premier is finally saying something that makes sense, in answer to a question. The problem is he still hasn't said how much it will cost, and he's now going to do a partial review but he keeps to himself the power to decide what that review will cover. The problem is that Nova Scotians have been down this road before.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, the Premier made a promise to cut the HST to 13 per cent by 2015, based on a projected or anticipated or hoped-for surplus that may or may not exist at some point in the future. The surplus is expected because of improved economic growth in 2013. RBC says that growth will be led by Deep Panuke, Shell, the shipyard and Donkin Mine. The shipyard and Donkin Mine, two of the four projects needed to generate a surplus, are now behind schedule. My question for the Premier is, with two crucial projects behind schedule now, how can this government promise a tax cut in 2014 and 2015?</p>

We have the costs of the federal prison plan coming down, the federal costs that are going to be downloaded to us, and we don't know the magnitude of those costs. We'll see definite decreases in health transfers coming from a new federal agreement starting in 2014; again, we don't know the full impacts of those. The Premier said the province will take a financial hit if demographics are not factored into the health transfers right off the bat because of our aging population. Clearly there's a lot this government does not know about the future threats to our finances.</p>

The precarious economic situation in the Strait has made this community resource a much needed institution and one that women and girls in the community turn to. Sadly, the Strait Area Women's Place funding ended on March 31st and the good work that the centre did in the community will come to an end.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, we're all blatantly aware of that, the question is whether the Minister of Community Services will find the funding to continue the service. The Strait area has been dealt some tough blows lately. Businesses have closed. Employers are downsizing or disappearing and this has undoubtedly had an effect on families in the region. In a letter to supporters of the women's centre, the Minister of Community Services says, "I wish I could do more."</p>

Antigonish Women's Resource Centre and Sexual Assault Services Association want to see it continue and have written letters of support to the minister.

          <p>MS. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure that the member opposite understands that it creates a very difficult position when a pilot project is funded by another source and when that project finishes, then the expectation is on the government to pick up those costs. So it's something that can create difficulties when you're looking at the budget situation and so that's what we have to consider as a department because this is not just the first time that this has happened in our province. It happens often when there's federal funding that may be just one year or from another source. So what they should do is go back to the other source of funding. That's what a pilot project is, usually when you run a pilot project, the hope is when it's analyzed at the end of that project, that if it's successful, then that particular funder that initiated it would continue on. However, as I said, we're always willing to meet and have open discussions with any community organization.</p>

          <p>MR. GAUDET : Mr. Speaker, the Collaborative Partnership Network - a network of nine specialized employment agencies providing services for persons with disabilities - is concerned for the future of their clients. They're concerned that the department review will result in a loss of specialized services for persons with disabilities - and 20 per cent of Nova Scotians live with some type of disability. These agencies have a proven track record of meeting the needs of people with disabilities and want to continue to offer that support to the community.

I fully understand their needs, I understand the priorities that the Collaborative Partnership Network has put forward. I have reassured them, as I have the House, their concerns are going to certainly be very carefully considered. It may be that, as I explained earlier, we have different models of service delivery, but certainly as a department and a government we owe the citizens of this province a thorough review, an opportunity to get through that review, and make decisions that will be in the best interests of all Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, the Irving shipbuilding contract is the single largest shipbuilding contract in Canadian history. Irving won the bid based on merit and we as Nova Scotians couldn't be prouder.

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Madam Speaker, as I said in Question Period today, Bill No. 84, an Act Respecting the Merger of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College with Dalhousie University, it's time to highlight the importance of agriculture in our province. There's certainly nothing about this bill, this piece of legislation, that will in any way downplay the importance of agriculture. In fact, everyone is hoping that it will lead to enhanced research and further acknowledgement of the primary role that the Agricultural College plays in support of the agricultural industry in our province.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I was very inspired by that last reading that we just had from my colleague from Kings West. Certainly the issue of education is paramount in our province. We know that's the future, it's the key for our development and our success as a province. We have had a reputation as a province within Canada that more than held its own, that punched above its weight in terms of the education ability and the young students that we graduated here in our province, but the system is under a lot of stress, and that is really what the resolution says today.</p>

I do appreciate the collegial debate that's going on here today as far as recognizing teachers. This being Teacher Appreciation Week, I know that all of us have had teachers who have had an important role in our lives.</p>

          <from>MR. ORRELL</from>
          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, we heard a math lesson that $17 million plus $13 million-plus was equal to $31 million, which was what they cut. But they didn't have anything in there about the inflationary costs that the school boards and the schools had to absorb as well, which has been estimated to be up to $35 million. So $30 million plus $35 million is actually $65 million. That's where the number came from, in case the math didn't add up there.</p>
