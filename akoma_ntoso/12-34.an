          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, I rise today on a point of privilege. As a member of this House I believe my ability to represent Nova Scotians as Leader of this Party is being infringed upon by not being able to table an on-line petition. As a matter of fact, the member for Halifax Clayton Park has asked three successive Premiers in this province - Premier Hamm, Premier MacDonald, and now Premier Dexter - to modernize this House so that we reflect the modern society that we live in today here in the Province of Nova Scotia and allow all Nova Scotians to have access to their House of Assembly.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Well, Madam Speaker, the Premier didn't seem to have any concern about that on May 10, 2004, when the Premier said, "What about the fact that this is going to mean a new regime imposed upon the municipality?" The recorded vote that followed had almost every single sitting member of the current NDP Government, who were the ones in Opposition at the time, vote against giving Imperial Oil a tax break - and I will table that - including the Premier.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Madam Speaker, of course that has no relationship or bearing to reality whatsoever but that's not unusual for the member for Dartmouth East. He should remember that Imperial Oil has an almost 100-year history in the community of Dartmouth. It has been deeply ingrained in the economic fabric of that community. For him to attack the workers who work at that refinery, to attack an economic asset for our region, I think is shameful. To suggest the continuation - not one cent of taxpayers' money went to that refinery. What happened was there was a continuation of a piece of legislation that was already in place that prevented the taxation on that refinery, which is already the highest east of Manitoba, from going even higher.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Madam Speaker, there are a couple of issues with what the Premier had to say. First of all, his own government's information shows it is nowhere close to the highest property taxes for refineries of its size in Canada. Secondly, if the Premier thought it was so important, he should have done as he said in 2004 and provided the tax break out of revenues of the province and not force another level of government to pass that on. Thirdly, the Premier voted against the legislation and said it was wrong when he was in Opposition. Now he's doing the complete opposite thing.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, that question goes from inane to bizarre. Exactly what we were doing was putting the workers at that refinery, their livelihoods and their families first. Furthermore, if he actually read what I said at the time, I did not say what he alleges I said. In fact, I said this was a complex issue, that there were many sides to be considered. That's what I said at the time. I can tell you this, I don't know what construction other people put on what it is that I had to say, but I do know that driving that refinery out of this province is not in the best interests of the people of Dartmouth that he's supposed to represent and it is not in the best interest of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, today we learned that the Imperial Oil refinery in Dartmouth is being put up for sale after more than 90 years in operation in our province. Sadly, that means that the jobs of 200 employees and another 200 contract employees are now at risk. This announcement comes just two months after the Premier gave that refinery a $3.6 million tax break but left in place the highest corporate taxes in all of Canada and the highest HST in all of Canada, which of course applies to retail gasoline. My question to the Premier is, why is Imperial Oil so anxious to leave Nova Scotia?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, I do have to say I find that question to be just dripping with irony considering that the member, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, at the time of the initial legislation that came forward with respect to that refinery was the chief of staff to the Premier at that point in time. They chose that particular manner of supporting the refinery. They put that legislation in place. They went out of their way to convince the Opposition that it was the best possible way to keep the refinery in Dartmouth. I find it is extraordinarily profound and ironic that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party should ask that particular question.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, the Premier's memory is pretty sketchy of that time. Let me remind him that at that time the HST was 13 per cent, the corporate tax rate was in the middle of the pack for the country, not at the top of the scale, that in exchange for that break the refinery made hundreds of millions of dollars in further investments and continued to operate for a decade afterward, not just two months. There's a pretty big difference between the history lesson the Premier just gave us and reality.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, you want to talk about sketchy memory, somebody who thinks that the HST was at 13 per cent back in those days - man, I'm telling you, that's a sketchy memory. In fact, the HST was at 15 per cent at that time so I just point that out if we're talking about a sketchy memory.</p>

BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, all Nova Scotians know that the provincial rate of retail sales tax 10 years ago was 8 per cent and it is now 10 per cent under this government; just to set the record straight it is up 2 per cent. The Premier of New Brunswick, past Premiers of New Brunswick, the business community of New Brunswick, none of them are waiting for someone else to tell them what to do like the Premier of Nova Scotia is. They are out actively working to secure the long-term health of that refinery in Saint John and all those jobs in a way that will actually deliver cheaper gasoline to the market in Saint John as a result. They're not waiting for someone else to do all of their homework for them, they're out and hustling now while our Premier sits back, idly by, handing out a tax break here and there, doing a bailout here and there and hoping for the best.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, well, quite the opposite. We have been working with the refinery to ensure that they're in the best possible position. The position that's taken by Imperial Oil does not have to do with taxation, it has to do with the fact that it no longer fits into its global distribution chain. This is something that has been on the horizon, unfortunately, for some period of time, so that's the answer to the question.</p>

In the document it says, "We are adamantly against any increase in the existing residential rate structure for Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (NSPI) and that we feel with the huge net profits collected by NSPI under existing rates, and with the protection of the Fuel Adjustment Mechanism that NSPI currently enjoys, any increase to current residential rates is pure greed and usury on the part of NSPI and its shareholders."</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Yesterday afternoon, Madam Speaker, the NDP Government released an executive study that was designed to tell Nova Scotians that gas regulation was working. This was a $40,000 report that went untendered and was instead handed out to a failed NDP candidate from St. John, New Brunswick, a long-time public defender of gas regulation. So my question to the Premier is, could the Premier explain to this House and tell all Nova Scotians why a $40,000 untendered contract went to a failed NDP candidate to produce an intentionally-biased report on gas regulation?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, we, of course, became aware that a filing was going ahead when the filing took place. My understanding is that Nova Scotia Power contacts all the Parties in the Legislature, gives them an update on what their plans are with respect to rate filings. My understanding is that they would have done that with the Progressive Conservative Party and with the Liberal Party. They do the same with us.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Madam Speaker, the fact of the matter is that Nova Scotia Power is now planning multiple years of power increases, not wanting to come back and ask again until after the next election, an awfully convenient way of going about business for the first time ever. I just want to be clear, I just want to confirm, that no one in the government, in the Premier's Office, in the Department of Energy - staff or otherwise - had any discussions with Nova Scotia Power prior to their filing about their interest in having a multi-year increase in our power rates.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, the answer to his question is no. He's quite right that the filings of Nova Scotia Power, of course, belong to them. I can say this, one of the reasons why Nova Scotians find themselves in this position today is because of the history of privatization that took place in the province.</p>

I know it's disturbing to him that there's nothing to support the theory that he has about this, but the the simple fact of the matter is - as it is with the economy, as it is with the deficit of the province - that even with respect to electricity, we are left to clean up the mess made by those two Parties.</p>

I certainly know that we're all concerned about power rates here in our province, from our most vulnerable citizens right up to small business and large industry. Trying to find the happy medium that allows a rate that is workable for large industry is what the URB is tasked to do.

This program is already seriously under-resourced and now we learn that on top of managing these caseloads, maintenance enforcement officers are being asked to make major life decisions with no information.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Madam Speaker, roads continue to be a major concern for the residents of Richmond County. Allow me to start on a positive note by saying we're very pleased that the minister and his staff have approved tenders to have the repaving of the road from Dundee to St. George's Channel, where the beautiful Dundee Resort and Golf Club is located, the road in Whiteside, along with the continued multi-year plan to pave Route 4 to Sydney, between the community of Johnstown to Chapel Island.</p>

          <p>HON. WILLIAM ESTABROOKS : I thank the young member for Richmond for a question. It's good to see that we're going to be talking on an important topic that I know you conscientiously have brought to my attention. I want to thank that member and the members opposite.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Madam Speaker, the minister will recall that I also raised in this House the road in Cape Auget, where the Clearwater live lobster holding facility - in fact, the largest live lobster holding facility in the world - is located. This road has deteriorated as well, and it has become a safety hazard for both the employees of that facility and local residents. As well, the main road in Petit-de-Grat, what's commonly known as the stretch to Boudreauville, is in terrible shape. This is the road that accesses the local community cultural centre, La Picasse; the local ball field; the credit union; and the Catholic church. I would again ask the minister, could he advise as to when the residents in Cape Auget and along Petit-de-Grat can expect to see action on their roads?</p>

          <from>MR. ESTABROOKS</from>
          <p>MR. ESTABROOKS : Madam Speaker, that sort of local input is important to this minister, because to be very candid with the member opposite, I have never heard of the stretch to Boudreauville. I will assure you that when the time comes, we will have the opportunity to see that particular stretch of that road. I want to bring it forth again, because I know there are members opposite who have a working relationship with me, myself, as a minister - it's important that I continue to hear from you with local priorities, but I urge you, in turn, to make sure that your priorities are on the same page as local staff.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Madam Speaker, the lower road in River Bourgeois, along with South Side River Bourgeois, is in need of repair, along with Grand Gully Road, which the minister knows I've brought to his attention due to repeated flooding which has taken place along that gravel road, as well as the residents in Loch Lomond, which has gravel roads, but they are certainly looking for upgrades to their roads. The minister will recall last year when he visited Little Harbour Road in L'Ardoise, where the main wharf is located which is the economic engine of that community, which is a gravel road in desperate need of upgrades in light of the heavy traffic that continues to travel on that road. That road needs to be seen as something to generate economic development, not simply because of what the counters would say for traffic on that road.</p>

          <p>MR. ESTABROOKS : Thank you, member, for the question. It must be my day with back-to-back questions on the important topic of roads. It's ironic that we have to deal with it at this juncture of the sitting. However, I want to bring to the attention of all members opposite - and I notice the member for Annapolis is sitting there, and I know, I can read his lips as he says to me, what about the Middle Road? Then I can look and make eye contact with the member for Colchester North, who of course knows how to do her homework as an old - as a mature teacher, sorry.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Madam Speaker, Holly Slaunwhite has seen her share of challenges in her 31 years. She's a bright, intelligent young lady with everything to live for, but she found herself caught up in an abusive relationship. Her mental health deteriorated, and rapidly so, when her former partner committed suicide. She visited her family doctor for help, and there she was given a phone number for mental health services in Dartmouth. She called and she got an answering machine. They returned her call two days later and told her to try again next week. She did, and she got the same answer: call again next week. So she returned to the family physician, who gave her another number. The problem was, it was actually the same phone number she had been calling in the first place. So Holly waited for months for an appointment with Dartmouth Mental Health.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, yesterday the mental health strategy was announced, and one of the features of that strategy is improvements in meeting the standards for addressing wait times for mental health. Those standards essentially require that people in a crisis be seen within 24 hours. People with urgent needs be seen within five to seven days, and people whose needs are not urgent will be seen in an additional period of time within 30 days, I believe, for a first contact in terms of assessment.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Madam Speaker, no doubt this situation sounds familiar to the minister because the minister received the same e-mail as the Liberal caucus did. There is a glimmer of hope in this case because Holly finally has an appointment. Oddly enough it happened the day after the minister received the e-mail.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Madam Speaker and I will begin again. I'm pleased to rise and speak on third reading to Bill No. 84. As I stated, many of the workers who are employed and have been for years at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College come from my constituency of Colchester North; as well, many of them come from Truro-Bible Hill, other parts of Colchester County and beyond. Those workers are very proud of what has developed and grown into a gem with the Agricultural College and I believe that the merger is a positive move and I'm not speaking against the merger, but there are a couple of issues that the employees there have brought to the attention of government, to the minister, to the Premier and, in fact, to the Law Amendments Committee. I had the opportunity to speak with the minister yesterday. I appreciate his time and his conversation and for him listening to the concerns that I was bringing on their behalf.</p>

It's not that long ago, and I have a memory of this in this House, around Section 31 of the Trade Union Act that was brought forward by the previous Progressive Conservative administration to ensure that when employees are devolved out of government to another institution, that they take their collective agreement with them and certainly that is the case.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to say a few words on Bill No. 86, the NewPage Port Hawkesbury Pension Plans Act. As I've indicated at the earlier stages of this bill we're certainly supportive of what is being done here which, in essence, is allowing the windup of the pension plan to be extended for a period of 11 years with the hopes that market conditions will improve and that the current losses that that fund has faced might actually be lessened for the workers.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I mentioned, it's the hope that with time the markets may help this pension fund bounce back by 5 per cent, possibly even as high as 10 per cent. We're certainly all hopeful of that. Clearly the government is not in a position, nor is anyone in this House, to be able to predict what the future will bring regarding market conditions, but we can all be hopeful. We're certainly pleased to be able to support the initiative that the workers have asked this House to do, and we stand with them in the hopes that their pension funds will be able to bounce back and that they will be able to continue to enjoy the retirement benefits which they have paid into for so many years.</p>

If the amendments I proposed last December were - this legislation has virtually the same intent as those amendments that were put forth last December. If my amendments and the media attention that they gathered have contributed in any way to this piece of legislation, then perhaps there is some hope that when in Opposition, we on this side of the House can still effect change in the province.</p>

Again, as I mentioned on second reading, I find the title of the Good Forestry Management on Crown Land Act a bit ironic. While I questioned the fact that both NewPage and Stora before it had received certifications for their forestry practices, we had the Ecology Action Centre come before us at the Law Amendments Committee saying that the bill does absolutely nothing, actually, to ensure good forestry practices.

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, I want to stand in my place for just a couple of seconds to speak in support of the bill the government has put forward. One of the reasons I support the bill is because Finewood Flooring in the constituency of Victoria-The Lakes, in the community of Middle River, has over the years been able to, through the good graces of NewPage, access some hardwood on Crown land. There was a concern by the owners of Finewood, at the time, that if the ownership of the mill or the transfer of the Crown land went to another company that they could end up losing their access to the hardwood product that would exist on the Crown lands.</p>

Whether those are in Yarmouth or Cape Breton or Cumberland County, it doesn't make much difference.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I think it's very important that the government has brought forward a bill that would ensure that the Maritime Link is reviewed and moreover that addresses a hole that was in the previous ability of government, as outlined by the deputy minister who said that there was no way they could have actually reviewed the components that were outside of the geographical jurisdiction of Nova Scotia. I think that's important and I certainly thank the government for listening to the calls for that from various sources that said that had to happen, so I'm glad they did that.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : I am pleased to have an opportunity this afternoon to rise on Bill No. 88, regarding the Maritime Link. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we put forward a bill in this House and debated it a week or so ago now, Bill No. 72, the Capital Projects Review Act that was put before this House, and it would have added to this bill. This is a good step, it was something that the government obviously saw that was of good use. It was things that we had discussed and proposed in the past, but it still falls far short of what we really need to have in place when it comes to such bills.</p>

But just in speaking across the floor, I wonder if it would be in order if the three House Leaders - I think we each want to go on record thanking the staff, particularly the Pages and everybody. We make their lives miserable but they make our lives just the opposite, very workable, and we're very fortunate to have them. On behalf of the government caucus, I want to thank them for all the work that they do to make this House and your job more efficient. (Applause)</p>

We would hope that they have had a rich experience in their time here in the Legislature. I'm sure they have probably seen elements of democracy that the average Nova Scotian will never get to see, in some cases probably doesn't want to see, but they do so every day, in the long hours that we sit with great professionalism, with certainly great discretion and certainly, we want to thank them and wish them well over the summer months.
