It is a time to express our gratitude to the people and organizations that do the caring and difficult work to face these painful experiences every day. Sexual violence is an enduring social issue and it is not unique to Nova Scotia. These are issues that are challenging governments, community leaders, organizational leaders, and parents around the world.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the amount of money the Premier has spent on marketing the NDP's agenda has many Nova Scotians shaking their heads over this government's priorities. For example, when it comes to public education, the NDP has cut $76 million from the classrooms, resulting in over 700 teacher-cuts, and wait lists for nearly 2,000 kids across the province, to access speech-language pathologist and school psychologist services.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course as usual, the preamble is entirely incorrect. We have not cut that money out of education and, in fact, we spent a great deal of effort and time in ensuring that we get the programming in place to deliver the best quality education to students in this province. In fact I can proudly say that the per capita funding for students in this province is at its highest level ever in this province.</p>

In the last four years full-time employment for young Nova Scotians, those aged 15 to 24, actually dropped by a staggering 12.6 per cent, a loss of 4,600 jobs for Nova Scotia young people. I'll table that seasonally-adjusted report from Statistics Canada.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, everyone who watches Question Period knows that that's not true. They know that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party simply cherry-picks pieces of Statistics Canada reports that don't reflect the reality of Nova Scotia at all. People who watch carefully know that Nova Scotia was the only province in the country to actually have a net gain in jobs in the last year. Every reporting organization, whether it's the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council or CIBC World Markets or the Bank of Montreal or any of them, says the same thing: Nova Scotia's economy has been resilient.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, perhaps the Premier is beginning to believe his own TV ads; he is the only one that does. It's time to change the channel back to reality TV, because that same report from Statistics Canada shows that for Nova Scotians in mid-career, full-time employment dropped by 10,600 jobs during his term of office - a drop of 4 per cent for those in mid-career. That's despite $590 million of corporate welfare borrowed and underwritten by the NDP.</p>

Nova Scotians aren't interested in what interest rate he's getting on his investment account which he has lent out to the Irvings, which he lent out to all these companies. They want to know whether jobs are going up or down. For our young people they're a minus 4,600. For those in mid-career, they're minus 10,600. I know that the Premier likes to blame it on the global recession, but you know what? For the rest of Canada, for that exact same time, the labour force grew by over 300,000 jobs.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, our health care system is facing immense pressures, escalating cost pressures, public frustration with wait-times and the Harper Conservative Government that will fundamentally change the way it funds health care which will negatively impact Nova Scotians. In light of all these pressures, could the Premier explain why maintaining 10 CEOs and 90-plus VPs and directors would be better adding than putting more money in front-line health care?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad he brought up this topic because in fact our record in health care administration is one of absolute success. We took a health care administration that had as a percentage of its budget some 6.7 per cent going into administration. We've reduced that below the national average. The one thing that we have not done is entered into the extraordinarily wrong-headed idea that somehow you amalgamate into a gigantic bureaucracy that takes away the voice of ordinary Nova Scotians from health care decisions and cost more expenses to patient care. That is the result of what he is proposing.</p>

Patients can travel to the various facilities they want to get the services they want, they can do that now - of course they can. The rest of us out here have lived through amalgamations that came about as a result of the Liberal Party. We watched the forced amalgamations and no money was saved.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, patients can travel to any facility in this province, but the problem is that we have nine districts that are trying to protect their own turf and not allowing patients to do that on a regular basis. It's not a first option, it's for those Nova Scotians who can find their way through the massive amount of bureaucracy we have in this province in order to do that. Ordinary hard-working Nova Scotians who can't find their way through the massive bureaucracy that is supported by this NDP Government have no choice but to languish on wait-lists in the districts where they live. So, while this Premier wants to protect the 10 CEOs, we want to give Nova Scotians quicker access to primary health care.</p>

The evidence that's mounting seriously contradicts the assertions of both the NDP and Nova Scotia Power about that megaproject; in fact the review board's own consultant found: "that Muskrat Falls has not been demonstrated to be a definitive least cost incremental supply source for our province's energy future." In other words it costs too much.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : The way the Progressive Conservative Party must be - they must be disappointed because the fact of the matter is exactly the opposite is true than what he says. In fact a number of consultants from the board have been hired, and all of them but one found that this was the best project for Nova Scotia, for ratepayers. They are looking at this project in-depth, as they are supposed to - in fact this project has more scrutiny than any project that has ever come before the Utility and Review Board, at least so far as I know, and I've been around for a while.</p>

The only person who has made up his mind regardless of the cost is the one that Nova Scotians are supposed to look to to protect them and that is their Premier but he is close-minded on Muskrat Falls.

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, since the minister has trouble answering questions about his schedule, I'll help him - he is not. I asked his predecessor in 2010, 2011, and 2012 whether she would meet with them, and on April 5, 2012, she said, "I do set priorities in terms of what needs to be addressed in making those decisions," and she goes on about accommodating people and so forth. So I guess this isn't a priority, which is funny because it was such a priority for NDP members from the Pictou ridings when they were in Opposition, and they championed having a health study done. In fact, the Environment Minister, on April 5, 2011, said that he understood the Department of Health and Wellness was going to undertake a health study on this issue. Yet there's no study that anybody is aware of and no meeting has yet occurred, despite the fact that the previous Health and Wellness Minister has been through Trenton.</p>

The issue is that the NDP MLAs from the Pictou area had committed that the Health Minister would meet. In previous Question Periods, this minister's predecessor said that she would make every effort to meet with this group. The Environment Minister stood in this House, on the record, and said that he understood a health study on the effects of the coal ash was underway through the Department of Health and Wellness.

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, the government has gone out of their way to make it difficult for small businesses to prosper. Independent power producers learn the lessons the hard way when they enter into competitions run by the renewable energy administrator to supply renewable energy to NSP.

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Certainly Nova Scotia is blessed with lots of wind, in fact it is estimated we have one of the best wind regimes in all of North America. We have small wind projects; we have large wind projects; we have the COMFIT Program for small wind projects in our communities, and that has been very popular; and we have our large wind projects administered through the Renewable Electricity Administrator. He went through the competitive bidding process. People knew going in that the minority partnerships were possible, and we have ended up with three projects that are the best possible opportunity, on the large wind projects, for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, last Fall, the Renewable Energy Administrator himself was concerned that the bid process would become less competitive if Nova Scotia Power was allowed to win every bid. He argued that the independent power producers might choose not to bid at all when the cards are stacked against them. Even the minister must realize the reduced competition for energy contracts means higher bills for ratepayers.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure where the honourable member is getting his research from, but in reality there were 19 applications under the Renewable Electricity Administrator program. Three of those were awarded contracts, and those were the three who had the lowest price for Nova Scotians, somewhere in the 7.5 cent rate per kilowatt hour, and in total, we are going to end up saving approximately $50 million - $50 million for the ratepayers of this province, over the lifetime of those projects.</p>

The rules say only Nova Scotia Power can appeal rulings, which is unlikely to happen when they are both the sellers and the buyers on the contracts in question. This is not fair. We know that.</p>

The province assumed a 1.2 per cent GDP growth rate last year, and were off the mark by a whole percentage point - so I guess they were turning the corner on accurate estimates.

Yet, in an effort to get some quick-and-easy photo ops, the minister and the government preferred to sign over blank cheques to large businesses with no targets or guarantees - 0.2 per cent growth across the province, which is a weighted average, of course, and Halifax is doing well, as we hear about the cranes in the sky.

When it came to automatic assumption, the former Minister of Labour passed a bill in here to protect coal miners. That's action, Mr. Speaker.

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations. As the minister knows, my area has over 9,000 apartment units in the Clayton Park riding and a lot of those are small, one-bedroom apartments, and people are often very careful with their usage of energy in those small apartments. My question relates to the Heating Assistance Rebate Program which, when the NDP came to power in 2009, they cut from $450 per recipient down to a maximum of $200. I have the form, there is no $450 rebate anymore, so the new program - the minister can say he didn't do it, but this program maximizes at $200.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, it's simply backward thinking to cut the very poorest people out of this rebate program, it's backward. The people living in small apartments, who are keeping their temperature as low as possible and using as little energy as possible because they simply don't have the money to pay those bills. They will have bills that are above the $200 that the minister is referring to as the threshold. I think it's not a way of making money, we're not suggesting it's a way to get money when you didn't spend it, it's a rebate program, the maximum would be what you had spent on your power, up to a $200 limit, which is already too small for many low-income people. It isn't even enough for people getting oil to have a delivery for $200.</p>

The Public Prosecution Service is an independent unit under its own direction, with its own director. That director has taken it upon himself to do a review so that he understands what has occurred within the Public Prosecution Service. At the same time, the RCMP is another branch of the justice system providing service within this province, and they, in fact, are doing a review as well. It's a responsibility on my part, then, to collect this information.</p>

Earlier in Question Period today the Premier talked about there being all these studies tabled in the Maritime Link hearings in favour of the Maritime Link saying it is the lost cost.

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : There is a lot of evidence, obviously as the honourable member is tabling some of it. Again, I'll stick to my understanding. There were about nine that were pro and five that were con, in these connections. You know, it all depends on your interpretation of how you read the evidence. The role of the URB is to determine what is the evidence, what is the best information, and they have to test the evidence; they have to review the intervener's evidence, and they have to cross-examine everything that is there. That is the role of URB, to look at all that evidence, determine what is right and what is fair - is it the best deal for Nova Scotians?</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I really do hope the minister will take the time to read the 14 studies that I tabled, which included his Dalton study, because only one of them actually said it's the lowest and fairest cost. Even if you include the two that don't talk about cost and say that the project is technically possible, and that's the only thing they looked at, you still only have three studies that are in favour of the project. The minister should stop representing the facts. Yesterday, the Premier was saying that because the repeat recipient of the fossil of the day award, Mr. Jim Prentice, said the Muskrat Falls was a good deal, it must be. Oh my goodness, I'm sure the Premier is also aware that many financial magazines have speculated that CIBC, where Mr. Prentice works, is trying to get some of the loans and investments for that project.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am delighted to rise and speak in support of Bill No. 64, which in basic terms is a bill to allow the URB, the review board, to do the job that it has always been able to do in the past, which is to hold hearings on behalf of ratepayers, take the time they need, set their own timeline, review all the evidence, and then make a decision that is in the best interests of electricity ratepayers of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. RAMEY : What is not to love? Anyway, to debate the resolution that not unlike previous Liberal and Progressive Conservative Governments, the NDP health care plan is putting patients first while reducing administrative spending. I'm very pleased to speak on this because in all seriousness it is a very, very complex and important issue for our province. I'm sure many are aware that health care continues to be the largest portion of the provincial budget, I think we all know that. In fact the health care budget accounts for about 41 per cent of our total provincial spending this year and I think equates to roughly $3.9 billion, with a "b".</p>

          <from>Madam Speaker</from>
          <p>The Liberal plan will throw the entire system into chaos, as it did in Alberta in 2009. This is what happened in Alberta, Madam Speaker : five years and almost $1 billion later, Alberta has seen worsening front-line care, doctors leaving the province, and almost no administrative savings. In fact, just last month Alberta announced that in order to reduce admin costs by 10 per cent, they would freeze salaries and implement a hiring freeze in health administration. That's the Liberal plan, and that's the Tory plan in Alberta. That's not our plan.</p>
