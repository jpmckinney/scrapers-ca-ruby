        <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
        <p>MR. SPEAKER : Order, please. The subject for late debate has been chosen for this evening and it reads:</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#a17abcb6-45ac-4a02-a639-9e63df869d46">
        <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
        <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday during debate on Bill No. 116, the member for Richmond referred to myself using the word "cowardly" and I believe that's an unaccepted term on the floor of this Legislature. So I would wish that the member opposite would withdraw that word and I do apologize for not bringing this forward but I think I wanted to wait to ensure that Hansard reflected the language that the member used, or the term the member used.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#75109949-5b99-4b9c-b9fd-d85a8ce227ab">
        <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
        <p>MR. SPEAKER : The word "cowardly" is well understood to be unparliamentary and I would ask the honourable member to withdraw the word "cowardly".</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#7577a3e3-867e-4d2e-a20f-cf0febdf9d97">
        <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
        <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm more than happy to stand in my place and withdraw the use of the word "cowardly" in referring to the minister who just rose and spoke.</p>
      </speech>

        <from>HON. MANNING MACDONALD</from>
        <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise on a point of order today. I think my preamble would reflect on the fact that it's important to remember that Legislative Counsel works for the House of Assembly and not the government.</p>
      </speech>
      <speech by="#c4b08611-ea50-4069-9042-1634c77a855e">
        <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
        <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, we, too, stand on a point of order on this issue where it has been made aware that the Legislative Counsel has been calling around to the possible presenters for tomorrow's Law Amendments Committee on Bill No. 102, that they were going to either have to present today or not be able to present at all. We're made aware that out of the eight organizations that were to present tomorrow, a number of them still have not been able to be contacted, nor have they made aware that they can make it or not. I think this is a horrible affront to the process in this House of Assembly where this process is being shut down far before we've heard the opportunity from businesses in this province to voice their opinions on a bill that's important to this province and to this issue.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, we've been hearing from stakeholders that presenters on first contract arbitration who are scheduled to present tomorrow night have been told to move their presentations to the Law Amendments Committee to this evening or they are out of luck. The Law Amendments Committee is the opportunity that all Nova Scotians get to have their voices heard on the government's agenda and this Premier is now putting a muzzle on debate over this contentious issue.</p>

They're all here in the regular order. (Interruptions) With the different time, we hope to be able to get through the presentations this evening and get on to amendments, and that, of course, is the work of the House.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Well, in the words of the Premier, that's simply not true. Presenters were told that they would be heard on Thursday evening at the Law Amendments Committee only to get phone calls today from the Legislative Counsel Office, under directions from this government, telling them, get them in tonight or they're out of luck. It is clear that the Premier has grown tired of hearing from Nova Scotia's largest employers about their concerns that this legislation will have on the Nova Scotia economy at a time when we're hearing of record job losses around this province. The Law Amendments Committee is the one opportunity that all Nova Scotians - regardless of their position on government legislation - have the opportunity to come forward and have their matters heard. My question again to the Premier is, why are you trying to muzzle debate from Nova Scotians and Nova Scotia's largest employers on first contract arbitration?</p>

My question is, why is the Premier continuing to push forward on labour law changes at a time when Nova Scotia employers are clearly saying it is not the right time?</p>

I have never seen Michelin take the time to express the concern over direction of this government and tonight we will have the opportunity. To date we have only heard a one-sided conversation the Premier had with Michelin, tonight we might get to hear exactly what was said to the Premier about first contract arbitration.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, today is a shameful day in this Legislature when this government is determined to squelch the voices of those who want to risk capital, who want to create jobs, want to employ a few Nova Scotians; when they shut down the very mechanism that we use in this Chamber to hear the voice of Nova Scotians when it comes to legislation before this House. It's a shameful day but it is not the first time that this has happened. In a recent submission to the original sham committee - the Labour Management Review Committee - the Employers Roundtable, which represents thousands of Nova Scotia jobs, warned the government that this will be viewed negatively for companies looking to locate or expand in Nova Scotia. The Employers Roundtable includes Michelin, one of the very companies that today the government is trying to shut up.</p>

That is what's going on outside this Chamber as we speak. When jobs are on the line the most offensive thing is that the Premier is shutting out the very people who want to come and tell his government why their plan is such a bad idea.</p>

All of them have had a full, ample opportunity to tell the government what their opinion is. What's more, as I pointed out, they all also operate in jurisdictions that have first contract legislation, why? Because we had decades of experience with first contract legislation. It creates a better working environment for both business and labour.</p>

The Premier says that he has heard enough but there is a lineup of people wanting to coming and tell his government what they think of his legislation and he won't let them. That's what's wrong today but ultimately companies like Sobeys, companies like Michelin, they have lobbyists, they'll have their say. So what the Premier is trying to stop is that there are thousands of small businesses that don't hire lobbyists, that don't have someone to speak for them, they're the ones that government is calling on the phone today and saying don't come tonight, we don't want to hear from you.</p>

The Premier has made it clear he intends to push through with first contract arbitration agenda regardless of how many Nova Scotians come before the committee and tell him it is the wrong agenda and it's the wrong time for our province.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, it depends on the rate category that they're in, but for residential ratepayers I think that will be 6.1 per cent. Of course the reason for that is because we continue to be shackled with fossil fuels in this province, but fortunately we have a government that has one of the most aggressive renewable energy plans in this country. It is going to get us off fossil fuels and provide long-term stability for electrical rates in this province.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, of course the structure of Nova Scotia Power and Emera were put in place by the Progressive Conservatives and Liberal Governments over many years. Their reference to the Utility and Review Board, the way that that operates, was put in place by those same governments. It is this government that has taken the HST off home electricity, something that that Party voted against.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it is that Party that increased 1,400 user fees outside of this Legislature; it is that Premier who has added the NDP electricity tax to every power bill in Nova Scotia; and it is that Premier who increased the HST by 2 per cent on every other thing Nova Scotians do in this province. Rather than trim costs and look for efficiencies, Nova Scotia Power is once again returning to the ratepayers. This monopoly is dictating the energy policies of this province and the Premier is standing by, letting it happen. Nova Scotia simply cannot afford another rate increase at 10 per cent.

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, we all know the Premier relies on the advice of people around him about the economy, advice that has seen us into catastrophic job losses and a crisis in rural Nova Scotia. One of the most prominent members of his economic advisory panel is long-time NDP supporter and career union boss Rick Clarke, President of the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour. The Premier made Rick Clarke co-chairman of the disastrous Labour Management Review Committee, who conducted a sham consultation that excluded the most important job creators in the province. The government will also hear from Mr. Clarke this afternoon.</p>

First we had Bill No. 100, then we had this first contract imposition. Nova Scotians fear what's next, and no more so than the 3,500 Nova Scotians employed directly by Michelin, the thousands of others whose livelihoods depend on Michelin, and the many other thousands of their family members.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the member misunderstands the manner in which the energy grid in the region operates. Indeed, Emera who, of course, is the parent company for Nova Scotia Power, regularly does business with Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec; in fact, they've purchased from Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec. When we have a call in this province for additional power, they go out into the marketplace, they look for power which they can import and, in fact, they do at times, bring in power from Quebec or from other, cheaper sources if they can access it. So, of course, we're always in the market to make sure that consumers in the province are receiving the best possible price for their power.</p>

          <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the Premier has indicated that he will be introducing legislation which will make changes to a lobbyist registration in our province. From all indications, these changes will leave a large loophole, specifically key Party operatives such as staff in the Premier's Office, ministerial aides, and caucus staff. These individuals will not be covered by any restrictions on lobbying government. So my question is, why would the Premier not include senior political staff in his changes to restrictions on lobbying in our province?</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, this is an issue on the minds of Nova Scotians because we currently have the former provincial secretary of the NDP now lobbying the very government he used to work for, the NDP Government for which he held the top post for four years. Clearly he is a person who has the ear of the Premier, the Cabinet, and the top staffers within the Premier's Office. The Premier has publicly stated that Ed Wark does not have insider information, yet this is the same person that the Premier dismissed over the election financing cover-up from within the NDP.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : I want to thank the Premier for allowing me to correct that because Ed Wark worked for the NDP Party for four years as their secretary and I want to thank my Leader for correcting me. It was not $10,000 that the NDP accepted in legal donations, it was $50,000 that they accepted in legal donations. The $10,000 was the fine that they were given from the chief electoral officer for violating the Elections Act. So thank you for the opportunity to be able to clear that up.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, lobbyist registration usually refers to people who are actually employed by government, not employed by private organizations. I want to ensure, of course, that the record is correct and, of course, in fact, Mr. Wark, I believe, resigned and was not fired. Finally, of course, the findings of the Chief Electoral Officer was that the Party knew, in fact, nothing about the background or the receipt of any money - those are the facts.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question, through you, is to the Minister of Education. In response to my question yesterday regarding the Hogg formula and the allocation of funds to school boards, the minister responded, ". . . the formula and the budget considerations are two separate things." Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more and most people in the House would know they are two separate things. The issue is that the question made no reference to budget considerations.</p>

The budget target is, for the want of a better description, the pie and the Hogg formula is the way you cut the pie. So the Hogg formula, at this time, is being revised with the collaboration of all of the school boards, we're still working on that tool, the tool that we'll be working with the budget that we will be coming forward with. That decision has not been made. So the pie, the decision hasn't been made and we're working on the tool to cut the pie. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Okay, did the minister say they weren't going to receive any money from the auction? (Interruptions) Okay. Well in the Spring session of the Legislature, it was brought to our attention that the NDP was using heavy-handed tactics to ensure that - I believe it was the Royal Bank - received money that was owed to them by SWSDA yet this government has yet to act to support the small local businesses that are also owed money by SWSDA, along with former employees.</p>

There are over 50 small businesses that are owed money from SWSDA and today, this government hasn't done anything to support them. For once, will this minister do something to support small business in the province and provide help to these businesses that need to have their money returned to them?</p>

Furthermore, what we've done is we've authorized a forensic audit of SWSDA, trying to reveal where those monies have gone to; taxpayers' money that we have devoted and dedicated to SWSDA, which didn't go to the causes that they were dedicated for.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, with the 2011 Fall lobster season now underway, Nova Scotians who depend on this lucrative fishery are already concerned about the predicted low price of lobster. My question is what is the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture's plan to address low prices for lobster in Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU : I respect the question. As the member opposite knows, low prices are being affected all along our coast. District 35 in the upper Bay of Fundy has just recently been involved with very high catches, historical highs. Our neighbours to the south, through the September-October season are also in very soft prices. I'm very aware of this, but we are working with our lobster council and we are very aware of the different options that are available to the industry. The industry is discussing these options as we speak, as these other districts open up, and there is ongoing dialogue. I look forward to assisting them in any way. Thank you for the question.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : As the minister well knows, this is not a new issue to Nova Scotia. When it happened a few years ago, the price of lobster was much lower, efforts were undertaken to try to identify new markets to look at value-added for the lobster industry because we all know, it's in our whole province's interest that lobster fishermen get a good price for their lobster because our economy relies upon it. My question to the minister is what new initiatives has this government put in place to identify new markets or value-added initiatives to get a better price for Nova Scotia lobster?</p>

          <p>MR. BELLIVEAU : Again, to the member opposite, there is a lot going on as we speak. There are discussions with the industry Atlantic-wide with our five provinces, including Nova Scotia, regarding the lobster council and all the different options available to the industry. Yes, I agree with the member opposite. Since 2008 the industry as a whole has suffered very low prices, what we see in the marketplace. There is a lot of work being done by our department, whether it's nationally or internationally, about developing markets in Asia and China, and all this is going on as we speak. Again, I look forward to having these discussions with the industry as we move forward. Thank you for the question.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : When the NDP were in Opposition they continued to ask governments of the day for a plan on how they were going to deal with problems. I know that the government in limited instances has tried to present plans on how they're going to deal with certain problems. We have differences of opinion as to how they're succeeding, but the question I have is that in light of the problems that exist with the lobster industry, that this is not something new but something that has been tackled by the previous government and now this government, will the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture present a plan to this House as to how his government plans on dealing with low lobster prices in Nova Scotia?</p>

This minister, this government, took action. We got the discussion going regarding the lobster council. There is discussion going on with our Atlantic friends and these are options that the industry needs to explore, needs to digest.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for an appropriately-phrased and well-put question. What I can say is that I have had the opportunity, as was indicated by the member, to meet with both the Prime Minister and with the minister responsible. I have pointed out in very similar words what the member of the Official Opposition has said in relation to the program. I've asked him to consider a series of changes recognizing that this was the first year we actually hit the 500-nominee target so that Nova Scotia would be able to recruit more immigrants.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I was looking to see, if indeed, he could confirm the 500? I'm not sure that was entirely confirmed. My understanding is that we are capped again for 2012 at 500 nominees or nominee families. The Premier knows full well that the Nominee Program allows the province to go out and market itself to the world. There is no other stream of immigration that enables the province to control its own destiny and ultimately its success in immigration.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, there was the joint opinion of the Premiers of Atlantic Canada that the caps on immigration on the Nominee Program would be detrimental to all of the provinces in the region, so that was sent for that reason. With respect to the submissions that were made to the Prime Minister and to the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism, they were made personally, by me, asking them to increase the nominee level to the province.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, we certainly know and the Premier knows as well, that this is one of the most important issues facing our province because we have demographic problems - we have an aging population, we have out-migration, which we have talked about here a great deal around the jobs. The Provinces of Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan and B.C., just to name four, have had significant increases of 400, 600, 300 - B.C. has 300 more nominees as well. Those provinces understood the same formula, those provinces lobbied hard and got what they needed for their province - that's an increase in numbers within the pie, as the other minister likes to speak about. All achieved it because their provinces and the governments in their provinces fought. My question to the Premier is, given that Nova Scotia has seen no increase and will again in 2012 see no increase in our nominee allotment, what will it take to make the Premier recognize the current strategy is failing?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism has announced that all of the nominee programs have been capped and not changed, for any of the provinces. In fact, the simple fact of the matter is that, until last year, the Province of Nova Scotia did not use the number of nominees that it was given. This government was the first government to actually use the number of nominees that were allocated. In addition, there are nominee quotas that have been assigned to the other provinces and this year, because some of them were not used, the Province of Nova Scotia was able to access some of the unused Nominee Program in other provinces.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, 3,241 residents of the Annapolis Valley signed a petition, and thousands more have spoken.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, if only it were working. Health dollars saved as a result of this decision, on paper are $125,000, in this half year; $250,000 for a year; even board members have indicated this won't be realized. Cost pressures associated with clogged emergency rooms will be far greater that costs saved. On September 16th the Minister of Health and Wellness met with officials from Berwick and, at the time, the minister committed to full consultation on the issue prior to changes made to the operation in October. Since that September meeting, the community heard nothing and officials were not consulted. My question to the minister is, why did the minister commit to further consultations when, in fact, nothing took place?</p>

I don't know why he thinks I committed to full consultations. My recollection is that I encouraged the delegation that I met with, of which the honourable member wasn't a part, to return to their community and collaborate with the Annapolis Valley District Health Authority which delivered the services there. I indicated to the delegation that I would encourage the district health authority to collaborate with those individuals.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, it must be the last question of the day, I think we've come to this but, you know, we certainly know that clear-cutting has gone on in the province for far too long at too high a rate. It fact, it is around 96 per cent of clear-cutting and that's what Nova Scotians said they no longer want. We had a full review through the Natural Resources Strategy and Nova Scotians told us over and over they wanted a change in the clear-cutting practices in this province, and that's exactly what we've done through The Path We Share: A Natural Resources Strategy for Nova Scotia.</p>

This government cares about our forestry practices in this province and we had a very comprehensive three-phase strategy session that listened to Nova Scotians, listened to experts in the field. As you know, we came out in August with The Path We Share: A Natural Resources Strategy for Nova Scotia, 2011-2020, and it lays out clearly there that clear-cutting practices in this province are not acceptable and that we have a goal now of 50 per cent clear-cutting only within a five-year frame.</p>

That's the part that allows low income Nova Scotians to keep the energy account without which they're not otherwise going to be able to keep the lease.

This is the government that has added 250 new child care spaces &#x2013; allowing 250 more families to work, to earn livings.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hear the honourable member talking chewing gum, that's a gum that's cost everybody in Nova Scotia 2 per cent more since this government has come into office. And they talk about re-chewing the bubble gum, well most families today have to re-chew that bubble gum in order to make it worth their while to buy. That's what we're debating here today.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased this evening to join the debate on Resolution No. 1857. I always like to put the debate in context and I know that several speakers now have addressed the resolution, but the resolution went something like this:</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I certainly will, and just to add to that, the labour force, having contracted by 14,800 - because on taking office, there were 506,400 Nova Scotians available to be in the workforce and the most recent number is 491,600 Nova Scotians available to be in the workforce.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, 3.2 per cent from the fuel adjustment mechanism and then the carryover from last year to distribution of an increase over the three-year period with what we've now been calling the Efficiency Nova Scotia tax added onto the electric bill, will bring us over 10 per cent. So we're getting very close to 20 per cent increase in electrical rates in just two years and Nova Scotians are really feeling that and impacting again on making decisions about keeping the lights on, keeping the heat in their home and having to make choices around food, medication, clothes for children, all these kinds of areas.</p>

          <p>MR. SIDNEY PREST : Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to give a little history, going back a few years on my involvement in the forest industry, both in the pulp mills, lumbering, as a landowner, a producer, a sawmill operator - I've pretty well done it all. I'm not here to criticize or lay blame on previous decisions that were made by previous governments, but I have to refer back to 50 years ago when the destruction of our forestry industry started.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad he left me an additional 30 seconds to give me an opportunity to tell him how much I respect his views and regard his views on forestry. We have talked on several occasions about forestry and what it has meant to him over the years and also the kind of knowledge and insights that he does bring. I know he speaks with great passion for how best forestry practices should be implemented on the widest scale in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and it was a pleasure to hear the member for Eastern Shore this evening; I'd like to hear more of him here in the Legislature. When I was looking at this resolution a particular part struck me and that's the proper stewardship of the resource. I guess if you want to do something with wood, people need to find products that we can make, that are competitive and if we can't find products that can be made competitively and sold, then we don't really have a problem with wood because we can leave it standing.</p>
