I will stand here, and that member over there, or any member over there, will not intimidate me; they will not bully me."</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. During the last election campaign the NDP promised to create 2,200 jobs per year. That would mean that this government should have created about 6,000 jobs by now. We consulted Stats Canada and they told us that since this government has taken power, Nova Scotians have shed 12,500 jobs. That would mean we are almost 20,000 jobs off their promise.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the manufacturing processing investments that we made in companies right across this province have, in fact, generated many jobs. As the member would know, we also face what is a very difficult international financial situation, one in which the county of Canada, in the last report of Statistics Canada, suffered one of the most severe job losses in a month-over-month basis in its history.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, 12,500 jobs lost under this Premier's watch, but he doesn't need to take our advice. Here are the headlines from around the province, they'll tell the story: The October job numbers are called grim by the Canadian Press; in September the News, in New Glasgow, reported job losses confirm economy's downturn; in August the ChronicleHerald reported, Cape Breton call centre to close, the company had received $1 million in provincial cash; the ChronicleHerald quoted, job stats worry economists.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite, our economic plan is working and, in fact, is creating jobs. It is very unfortunate that the world economy is suffering through one of its most difficult periods. The U.S. housing market continues to lose a number of starts; and with economies not just in the western world but throughout Europe and other parts of the world, there is significant economic turmoil. We are not an island and we feel those results. When call centres close, unfortunate as it is, it's actually because of things that are happening in other jurisdictions, not what is happening here.</p>

          <p>MR.

We've lost 12,500 jobs under the Dexter Government, and 14,800 people have also left the workforce - that's why our unemployment rate is going down. That's 14,800 Nova Scotians who have given up on working in this province.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. The Auditor General's Report was released today and it found that the Department of Agriculture is not ensuring compliance with the meat inspection regulations. This revelation will be a surprise and alarming to many Nova Scotians who rely on the department to inspect the food they eat and who remember, all too well, the food-related tragedies a few years ago in Ontario. The Auditor General says, "Many facilities are not taking meat safety as seriously as they should."</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I don't know how the minister can say that because the Auditor General found that there is no formal policy in place for auditing the food processing facilities of our province. There is an informal policy that says they should be inspected monthly, but do you know what? That's not happening. None of the facilities, zero, that are supposed to be audited monthly have been audited monthly. Not the slaughterhouses, not the meat processing facilities - in fact six of the eight that were reviewed by the Auditor General had not been inspected in more than a year.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, what the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the point he's trying to make - I think he's confusing two things. One is the issue around audits, the other one is the issue around inspections. One of the things that the Auditor General did say is that the provincial Meat Inspection Act requires that animals are inspected prior and after slaughter, and he indicated this is being done. He indicated that the staff have the training necessary to be doing this. In the legislation, that is a part of the Act, that they have to do that and they're complying.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Well, Mr. Speaker, I'm sure all Nova Scotians will be rushing out to the nearest deli taking great comfort from that answer from the minister here this afternoon. The fact of the matter is that when inspections are done - when they are done - the Auditor General found that the department is not taking the appropriate action to ensure deficiencies are corrected in a timely manner. That is what the Auditor General has said today.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, not only this minister and my department but this government considers food safety and the safety of Nova Scotians as paramount. The thing that the member opposite did not indicate is what he means by deficiencies and the Auditor General couldn't find those deficiencies in those numbers if there wasn't some record system. He would never be able to indicate what plants, you know, had not had an audit or whatever.</p>

The neglect from this government has hit rural Nova Scotia hard and people are voting with their feet - 2,300 have left the workforce in Cape Breton; 1,400 in the South Shore; 1,800 in the Valley; and in the southern region, 4,300 people.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Agriculture. The Auditor General outlined a number of serious issues within the Department of Agriculture's meat inspection program. One of the areas highlighted by the Auditor General was that of water testing. Each facility is required by regulation to have a supply of potable hot and cold water. Given the nature of the work done at these facilities and our knowledge of the risk associated with bacterial infections, the Auditor General's assertion about the importance of uncontaminated water to a facility's sanitation seems very obvious.</p>

          <from>HON. JOHN MACDONELL</from>
          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, the department does not take a casual approach to anything. Testing does occur once a year in these facilities, at least once a year and because these facilities are not open to the public, as other facilities might be, so there's a difference in that requirement. The member opposite mentioned listeria - that's the responsibility of CFIA.</p>

          <from>MR. PORTER</from>
          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, another chilling discovery made by the Auditor General was that there is still no policy that requires bacteria testing. The department explains they plan to require facility owners to test for bacteria, but they don't. Again, I must refer to the outbreak of listeria in 2008. If that didn't raise awareness for the department, then I'm not sure what will. My question to the minister is, now that Nova Scotians have been made aware of the lack of oversight we have in meat inspection program, can the minister tell Nova Scotians when they can have some peace of mind about the meat products coming out from within our province?</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, in the interest of time - our process in our meat inspection facilities is set up to ensure that the product leaving the plant is healthy. The issue around listeriosis or listeria comes under the federal government. It's CFIA, it's not the province.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, in the department's responses to the Auditor General, they reiterate again and again the fact that there have been no issues. This is not only luck, but it is also an assumption. Rather than play Russian roulette with the health and safety of Nova Scotians, the department should take responsibility and understand that there's no excuse for this laid-back approach. My question to the minister is how can the department justify failing to respond to four of the recommendations to the AG, recommendations that could have serious public safety implications?</p>

We will act on all the recommendations of the Auditor General and I want to make it clear that the department investigates any issue that comes to the department - that's from individuals who call the department. We have the food safety specialists to investigate, they can come from the DHA, they can come from a physician, they can come from the Department of Health, any issues raised we will inspect. As a matter of fact, we will contact the individuals who got sick and we will trace back three days, we'll interview them and go back three days on where they've been eating, what they've been eating and try to trace what the source of the contamination was. In all of the ones that I mentioned earlier, 623, we have never been able to trace one back to a food inspection facility in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's Report today revealed some alarming deficiencies in the province's Meat Inspection Program. Within the first paragraph of the report summary, Section 3, it states, ". . . the Department of Agriculture is not doing an adequate job of managing the facility audit process." As a result the audit process is not sufficiently effective in mitigating all public safety risks associated with the slaughtering and processing of meat.

I don't know if I can tell the member exactly when the Act was rewritten, it was updated, but the regulations haven't been updated - I think they go back to 1990 - and my staff has raised that as a concern.

With that said, it is our target to implement the recommendations of the Auditor General by the summer of 2012 at the latest, and if it takes us longer to get the regulations up to date, that may happen, but certainly it is our intention to act on the recommendations as soon as possible.

If the member has something he wants to raise, I think I would be very glad to hear it. The Auditor General did indicate that our staff were trained to do the task they are required to do. One of the very first audits that is done is a walk-through, so those plants will not start if the inspector is not pleased about the condition of the plant. As a matter of fact, although the deficiencies are numbered one, two and three, we have a category we refer to as four and five, but those plants won't open.</p>

The question was about the board which that minister, the Minister of Energy, is responsible for and it's a shame that minister doesn't recognize that he's responsible for the board. The question was whether he stands by the two oil companies that the Auditor General has pointed out or whether he stands by the Auditor General, it's as simple as that, and he didn't want to answer.</p>

(Interruptions) There are issues raised that are not part of the dispute about whether they were audited. The Auditor General said - and I have read the response from the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board, and they do not take issue with the fact that the Auditor General said that he can't actually determine whether issues are being done safely. I asked the minister what he plans to do to ensure that there is safety in the offshore. Well, apparently he has no plans.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health and Wellness, on April 6, 2011, indicated that her department was working with the Diabetes Care Program, who at that time had completed a scan of the type and level of financial assistance available for insulin pumps across the country. The minister also stated she would be looking at a program rollout in New Brunswick after they announced they would be funding insulin pumps. Given that the minister has been studying this issue for at least the last eight months and it has been an issue before the minister's office within the department for at least three years, my question is why have we yet to see this government take action around funding for insulin pumps?</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as you know, diabetes is an illness that many Nova Scotians have. There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. A small number of provinces in Canada provide coverage for insulin pumps for children with type 1 diabetes. New Brunswick has adopted a program, and I believe they're in the process of evaluating the impact of that program. What I said last year still applies. We will await the results of the evaluation to look at what we can learn.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Better management of diabetes, whether it be through funding of insulin pumps or through funding for diabetic-related medications, is an investment. It's not a cost. It's an investment in patient care. It reduces visits to physicians; it reduces future costs associated with heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and depression, all of which are risk factors associated with poor diabetes management. My question to the minister is when will the management of diabetes become a priority for her government?</p>

I thank the honourable member for the question, because it gives me an opportunity to talk about our Better Care Sooner plan, which is the plan that we have to invest in primary health care and chronic disease management across the province. We are working very hard in our district health authorities around the province. We have numerous new collaborative health care teams that are doing an amazing job in the area of chronic disease management. We will continue to invest in the primary health care area to better manage chronic diseases, including diabetes.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I guess we need to remind Nova Scotians that in 2010 this government attempted to limit blood-testing strips to two strips per week in order to save money. Unfortunately, they were forced to reverse this short-sighted decision. This is a province where Type 1 diabetics earning the lowest incomes pay some of the highest out-of-pocket costs to manage their diabetes in the country. These are facts this government cannot ignore. When can Nova Scotians expect an announcement around some form of funding for insulin pumps?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, first of all, I think I need to correct the erroneous statement by the member with respect to attempts to limit blood-testing strips. People who have diabetes do need to test on a regular basis. However, it's also true - and there is very good evidence - that the drug companies have promoted testing for people who do not need to be tested. The important thing is that we need to be using our health care dollars where the evidence is to support outcomes that will make a difference, not using our health care dollars for things that aren't going to improve people's health.</p>

MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, in response to the Nunn Commission, the NDP Leader and now Premier said in a 2007 opinion piece in the weekly news that it is important for judges to have good options in front of them. He was aiming those thoughtful comments at options post-sentencing, but the same principles apply for issues of pre-trial detention or release. With a case-processing target of 98 days, youth in serious trouble typically go months on some form of release. The inability to have strong supervision leaves a huge gap.</p>

Now the Auditor General outlined, today, the serious gap that exists between the options that Youth Court judges have between detaining a youth before trial and releasing them with limited supervision, a gap that exists in this province and through which many youth fall because the government backed off on implementing a bail supervision program. That gap endangers the public and causes youth who are poor and have fewer supervision options to be detained more often than others.</p>

In some cases a household income of just over $28,000 means they make too much to qualify. To put this into perspective, if two parents from Kentville each worked full-time, minimum wage jobs, they earn too much to qualify. Too many Nova Scotians are being left out of these programs.

But there's more to that program, if the individuals sit down and talk to our caseworkers, there is often the opportunity there, it depends on how we're looking at their income. That's what I always encourage individuals to do is not just look at the application but to make an appointment so that they can have the opportunity to sit and discuss with the caseworker because often when we look at those income levels there is a variety of other items in there that can be taken into account in terms of what their eligibility is.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, had I been allowed to complete the filing of the documents that I had - I will also file this one that shows that road traffic from New England into Nova Scotia went up during that same period, which means that ferry traffic went down, leading to this very unfortunate graph which I will also table showing the continued plummeting of ridership on the ferry.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Madam Speaker, it's interesting that, you know, it's important if we're going to have a discussion about this, to have the correct facts. The Tories brought in EGSPA in 2007 which - listen, as I understand it, I wasn't here at the time but I believe all Parties supported that bill at the time. The issues on the renewable energy side that are being dealt with before the board now are costs that were in that Act in the early years, which have not actually been changed, much as I would like to blame the NDP for that, they're actually the costs that the Tory Government had put in for those early years - I can't believe I'm going to say this but the member for Halifax Citadel-Sable Island is correct - that they proposed. I can't believe I just said that out loud.</p>

The fact is, when the NDP were in Opposition, they were railing about how the URB was not working for Nova Scotians and how Nova Scotia Power was not working for Nova Scotians. Now it is actually the complete opposite that they are saying. It's like night and day. It isn't even a slight shift - it's the complete opposite end of the spectrum.

On the heels of a week of remembrance that we all took part in, celebrating and honouring and recognizing, it always raises a question in my mind of how can I, as a person who is so proud of the military traditions and presence and friendships that I have in my community, how can I encourage people to think about these sacrifices and these contributions every day, beyond the day of November 11th ?</p>
