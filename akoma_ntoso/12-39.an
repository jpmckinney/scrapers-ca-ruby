          <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to stand today before you and the members of the Legislature to share and celebrate some of the success in our plan to ensure that families across Nova Scotia - especially seniors - who need doctors, have them where they need them. Today, many families have been waiting too long to see a physician. I know, as members of the Legislature, we hear from residents across the province on this important issue. Many of them are left with no choice but to visit their local emergency department for basic care, and we recognize the importance of ensuring that residents in Nova Scotia have access to primary care, I think, in the appropriate settings.</p>

          <from>MR. LEO GLAVINE</from>
          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of Health and Wellness for an advance copy of his statement. I think we need to start at the very beginning by saying that this is not so much about the work of the NDP Government, but on behalf of the caucus, acknowledge the efforts of the district health authorities, College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the Dalhousie Medical School for their respective roles in ensuring the delivery of 12 new family doctors to rural communities throughout Nova Scotia. Without the hard work and dedication of these entities, this ministerial statement would not be happening. For the communities fortunate enough to find themselves on the list today, these new physicians are largely replacing physicians who have either retired or left the practice of family medicine in this province.</p>

A great statement from my colleague from the Liberal Party and I have to say a lot of heat and passion in that one and I want to thank him for that. I do want to thank the minister for providing me with a copy of his remarks well in advance. With the previous minister, the practice had been to be a little late in getting these to us in time so it was good to get them way ahead.

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, on Monday night of this week, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, and Environment was asked to release details of a lease agreement that was signed between his department and the Cornwallis Park Development Association. On Monday night the minister said he was unable or unwilling to release the details of that arrangement. Yesterday the Premier said he would disclose the details of that lease, so my question to the Premier is, when can we expect to see the details of that lease?</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned to the press outside just a short time ago, I think there is a fair amount of misinformation about this that has been, for some reason, either by way of rumour or inquiry more than anything else, which is this - there is an agreement to lease. There is not a lease in place at this time. I have asked for that file to come back to our office for review. I know there had been questions about it. I have similar kinds of questions but I think, as I've said, at this point it is a subject of speculation. I want to see what's actually in it and make sure all the information is properly released, when it can all be released at once.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, details of this lease are finding their way out through different sources from the community and, quite frankly, here in Halifax. The property in question that the government has leased just recently sold to the Cornwallis Park Development Association for $162,000. On Monday night, the minister told the media and all members who were there that the lease arrangement is for $287,000 per year. My question to the Premier is, how can signing a lease for $287,000 for 10 years, almost $3 million from the taxpayers of Nova Scotia, to lease a building from an organization that just paid $162,000 is a good deal for today's families?</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the kind of misinformation that we're talking about. The reality is that there is an amalgamation of a number of departments going in. It's not just a building, there are garage facilities, a helipad; there is a whole lot of other land that is included in that lease arrangement. It also includes somewhere between $850,000 and $1 million worth of fit-up costs that are associated with the lease. I think what we need to do, certainly, and as I said, we're certainly willing to release all of this information, at an appropriate time, once we've had an opportunity to bring it all together, because we here, I think, as all Nova Scotians do, want to make sure that this is the right arrangement for that community and the right arrangement for the taxpayers of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : The Premier said he didn't know much about the lease, about the arrangements that were made and now he is rhyming off a number of scenarios, Mr. Speaker. The Premier knows full well the full details around this arrangement and what he knows now though is that the media and this caucus has caught the fact that this government has signed a lease that is unacceptable to the taxpayers of Nova Scotia.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I just want to correct the Leader of the Official Opposition. He said it was $162 million, I don't know where he got that figure from. That is obviously incorrect but if there is inexperience, it would certainly be in the caucus of the Liberal Party in not understanding the way in which leases are arranged. They include not just the purchase price but they include a whole suite of improvements that have to be done.</p>

          <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Staying in the same vein, my question is to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. As reported in allnovascotia.com, the NDP agreed to spend $133,500 per year to lease an Annapolis County building that sold last week for $162,500. This group will make $1.1 million off their investment from this government's lease. Mr. Speaker, that is a return of 721 per cent. That is a return that's even better than Nova Scotia Power shareholders get. All expenses included, the rent comes to about $289,000 per year. So my question to the minister is, what precautions were taken to make sure that taxpayers were not paying more than they should for this space?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : I want to thank the minister for allowing the opportunity to deal with the question because, first of all, I think it's an important one. One of the things that we want to ensure is that the people of the province always get the best value for their money and in this case, Mr. Speaker, what you have is a non-profit community development organization, one that runs services for those communities, including cadets and other organizations. The lease arrangement with them is based on a good-value business case and the idea is that the lease would include all the facilities, the garage, the helipad, and it would include, as I said earlier, almost $850,000 to $1 million in fit-up costs. So what we're doing, what I've asked to be done, is to have that file sent back for review so that we can make sure the business case was set out properly and that it accomplishes its aims. The aim here, Mr. Speaker, is to ensure that good jobs end up in rural Nova Scotia and that we assist communities in rural Nova Scotia that need assistance.</p>

          <from>MR. D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : We all agree that moving departments to rural areas is a good idea. The Premier said yesterday that it would be - actually, as of yesterday he said that the move would be cost-neutral, but of course this government has shown no proof of that. Now it sounds like the Premier has it on hold as he reviews it. Yesterday the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture said we think it's a fair market value. A way of determining fair market value is to tender the space, but this government thinks that they know better than anyone else.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Thank you again. I would like to thank the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture for allowing me an opportunity to answer the question. The reality is that we're dealing with a co-operative, or a not-for-profit organization. As the member opposite knows, there are specific procurement rules that were followed by the government when dealing with not-for-profits. I hope he would know that, because this is something that the former Progressive Conservative Government did - I think four times.</p>

Then on Tuesday they dragged their feet, releasing the information after repeated inquiries.

I don't know what the Opposition has or why they think that a community development organization somehow is an illicit organization to try to deal with. I mean, we are working with a community group to ensure that departments get the best possible place for them to be able to deliver those services. So we have no problem with the release of the information. I said we're going to review the file, and once we've finished reviewing the file, we will release the information.</p>

I wonder if the minister would be prepared to make that information available to this House, what other buildings they looked at.

My understanding, and I don't have the name of the person who signs the document - there are 2,200 people working at TIR and I haven't had an opportunity to meet all of them - I don't know. I certainly didn't sign a lease, so I know that hasn't happened yet, and it would be up to me to sign it.

In the last year Nova Scotia has shed 8,600 full-time jobs. They've added 13,500 part-time jobs in that same period. The unemployment rate is down because this Premier and this government are creating a race to the bottom and forcing Nova Scotians into part-time employment.

Yesterday, we learned that even our amateur hockey players are not safe from this new trend, as we learned that the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles have received an application from a national union to organize, and I will table the statement from the Screaming Eagles when they indicate that they received an application from the Canadian Hockey League Players' Association, seeking to certify our children amateur hockey players under their union.

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : The minister's department is responsible for investing taxpayers' dollars to generate employment and help develop economic opportunities in this province. So if the minister wants to meet, what I want to know is if he will be available and willing to tell me how he failed Nova Scotians with $60 million of their money in Trenton? That's my question for the minister.</p>

An example of that would be the 14,000 jobs that we protected in Cape Breton; if we didn't do that, there would be families in this province that would be left out.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, the federal government received a request under the Access to Information Act to make public the umbrella agreement that the federal government signed with the Irving shipyard in Halifax. They agreed to release parts of those agreements. Irving Shipbuilding initially requested the courts stop the release of this information but withdrew the request. Now both the federal government and Irving Shipbuilding are in agreement with that information being made public. Does the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism agree that a key condition to spending public money, or accepting public money, is being open to public scrutiny?</p>

When we came into government, there was a fund of money that was the result of a trust that was set up between the federal and provincial governments.

The Premier and the NDP Government ordered the commission to eliminate the protected ridings of Clare, Argyle, Preston and Richmond. One of the casualties of the Premier's interference has been the riding of Shelburne.

They met with the terms of reference that was decided by the House of Assembly and they produced a report, as I pointed out, that did not address the position in Shelburne.

Of course the decision to travel will ultimately be the decision of the committee.

As the minister is aware, the request for proposals for a recovery house in Cape Breton closed recently and Talbot House in Frenchvale was the sole applicant. Now the board of Talbot House was reluctant at first to submit an application based on the government's requirement that any new recovery house use methadone. The minister must be aware that this is going against the philosophy of Talbot House, which was the last remaining recovery house in the province to not use methadone treatment. My question through you to the minister is, is the minister going to insist that methadone be part of whether or not Talbot House is successful, or will he give Talbot House the freedom to use their own method of treatment?</p>

Talbot House's 17-bed facility was successful in changing the lives of men with addictions for more than 50 years. It was effective, trusted and respected. The minister said a review would be complete by the end of the year, so my question to the minister is, with only one RFP submitted and the fact that Cape Breton has been without a recovery house for months, will the minister guarantee to open a recovery house in Cape Breton as soon as possible?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I recognize the importance of recovery houses, throughout the province and the one that was in Cape Breton, we recognize the importance of that. We know that there are addiction services being provided in Cape Breton currently, and as I said to the member earlier, we're reviewing the RFP process. We're going to make a decision and we want to make the right decision to ensure that we can continue to meet the needs of Nova Scotians, especially the needs of men and women in Cape Breton who find themselves struggling with an addiction. I look forward to that process and I look forward to an announcement soon - hopefully by the end of the year - on this decision, so we can provide services in Cape Breton as well as the rest of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, on November 5, 2009, Bill No. 52 was given Royal Assent in this Legislature. At that time, government indicated the bill would provide public accountability to communities and ministerial accountability for emergency departments. Given that legislation points to the fact that a report needs to be tabled annually, I'm not sure whether to ask the former minister or the current, but we'll go with the current. What has prevented the minister from tabling the Emergency Room Accountability Report, as is mandated by law?</p>

We now have waited 531 days for this government to, once again, be accountable to the public as to their success in ensuring all ERs are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As if it isn't bad enough Nova Scotians have to wait to access health care services, now they also have to wait for this government to be accountable. Could the minister outline the specific reasons as to why there has been such a delay in the release of the Emergency Room Accountability Report?</p>

          <p>MR.

We're not doing it the Liberal way - cutting and slashing, firing doctors and nurses. We're not doing it the Progressive Conservative way, when you just stick your head in the sand and ignore all the issues.</p>

We recognize that, but the one thing we are sure of is that we're responding to those issues. That's why I was glad to announce today welcoming new doctors to Nova Scotia under the CAPP, all of them practising in rural communities. That's why I was glad to go meet five new residency doctors down in the Valley - down where the member's riding is - who are doing a new program under the residency program here in Nova Scotia. All five of them took their training outside Nova Scotia. Four of them are from Nova Scotia, but I've got to say the most exciting one that I talked to was the lady from Ontario, who's from Ottawa and who loves the Valley. She said to me about a month after the program that she is staying here in Nova Scotia.</p>

This bill is entitled An Act to Ensure Accountability in Providing Economic Development Assistance in Nova Scotia. This bill speaks directly to the level of largesse that the NDP Government is demonstrating over the last three years with corporate handouts, corporate welfare and corporate giveaways, without the control and without the transparency that would ensure that Nova Scotians know what the deals are, and without knowing that the deals are good for Nova Scotians.</p>

It has been interesting to listen to the member for Halifax Clayton Park speak to Bill No. 103 but I think it's somewhat ironic that the Leader of the Official Opposition would bring forward a bill about accountability and economic development. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should be looking to his right and chat with the member for Cape Breton South about when he was Minister of Economic Development, but perhaps that may not help to educate the Liberal Leader because when the member for Cape Breton South was the Minister of Economic Development, he actually spent more time under RCMP investigation for influence peddling than he did helping the economy in this province.</p>

As with all investments, sometimes certain information must remain confidential to protect the competitive interests of Nova Scotian businesses. I think Nova Scotians understand that. I don't know if the members of the Opposition understand that but it's part of doing business and if this information was not kept confidential, businesses may lose their competitive advantage in the province and around the world, or worse, and certainly this would be worse, they might go out of business, costing Nova Scotian workers (Interruptions)</p>

We in the PC caucus are all about transparent and open government, but it's a shame that we have to bring a bill forward in this House in order to get details from the government on the other side.

VICKI CONRAD : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise to speak to this very important topic this evening: "Therefore be it resolved that this House ask the Liberal Party to be clear with Nova Scotians, and explain why they want to adopt an energy scheme that will drive up power prices by 30 to 50 per cent"</p>

          <p>MS. CONRAD : I wrote my own script, thank you. (Interruption) Then come see my notes. Does this plan, Mr. Speaker, sound like it will reduce rates in Nova Scotia - the plan that the Liberals are proposing? No, it does not. Nova Scotians deserve a government that can formulate and implement a plan &#x2013; one that is forward thinking and progressive - a government that, before they go out and trumpet a plan, actually does the background research to see that that plan has worked in other regions and our government has done that work and research.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing on a few comments that the member for Queens mentioned tonight. These are difficult times for Nova Scotia and in our history, never before have we been under an NDP Government and never before have times been tougher than they have been on Nova Scotian families.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure to stand and speak for a few moments on this resolution. It was great, it was absolutely great to see the member for Queens stand up and say a few words in this Assembly because, ultimately, in the last number of months, if not number of sessions, we've heard very, very little from the member for Queens. As a matter of fact, all through the whole issue about Bowater, well, you know she showed up on TV and things that were happening, behind her Premier, but when it came to actually defending her constituents here in the House of Assembly what did we hear from her? Absolutely nothing.</p>
