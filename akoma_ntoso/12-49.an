          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, this government likes saying it is time to do things differently; it's time to turn the page; it's time to get Nova Scotia's economy moving in the right direction. After three years of the worst economic growth in Canada, after the loss of 3,400 full-time jobs, the second lowest wages in Canada, with more Nova Scotians unemployed now than during the recession, we couldn't agree more with the government. This government has failed to turn the economy around despite handing out hundreds of millions of dollars of corporate welfare, so my question to the Premier is, why has this government failed to grow Nova Scotia's economy?</p>

DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out yesterday when I tabled numerous headlines around the job growth that has taken place, there are 7,600 more people working today than there were when we came to power in June 2009. We have more companies coming to Nova Scotia, just the example of almost 1,000 jobs committed to last week.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it's too bad Nova Scotians weren't boasting about this government at the rate they are in Winnipeg. It is not the people in Winnipeg who are suffering under his 2 per cent increase in the HST; it is not the people of Winnipeg who are suffering under his 1,400 user fees that have increased under this Premier; and it's not the people of Winnipeg who are paying the NDP electricity tax.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, one thing is true and that is we have just come through, as the United States has, and indeed as the world has, three of the most difficult recessionary years in our history, but you know what doesn't help? What doesn't help is the kind of insult that is issued by people like the member for Dartmouth East and what I would really like to know is whether or not the Leader of the Liberal Party is going to ask the member for Dartmouth East to apologize for something that shows the manner in which the reckless inexperience of that member would actually drive companies out of this province.</p>

          <p>MR.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out, we just came through three of the most difficult recessionary years in our history but throughout that you only had to look yesterday at Nova Scotia and at Halifax and some 30 cranes over Halifax, the first time in decades that that has happened. We have signed the largest industrial contract in the history of this province, a billion dollars being invested in our offshore after years of decline. All of this is work that results from the jobsHere plan and I would point out that that is a plan that actually came from the private sector, it came from the business community, from community representatives.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, we learned yesterday that the Premier likes to govern by headlines, although I can't help but notice he sets a new record today by having to go all the way to Winnipeg to find a favourable headline for his government.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think only the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party could mistake a letter to the editor with a headline, but I would just point out to him that right next to that letter to the editor was a second letter to the editor talking about the good sense of the Nova Scotia Government with respect to a fully hedged energy portfolio and how that in fact is the right way to go.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Well, in fact, Mr. Speaker, I do have that second editorial with me, and I will table it for the benefit of the House because it says something very interesting. It says that the cost of building a natural gas-fired electricity plant would leave Nova Scotians with electricity in the area of 5 or 6 cents per kilowatt hour. It also says that, based on the new higher cost of Muskrat Falls, it expects that Nova Scotians will be paying in the area of 14 cents a kilowatt hour - almost three times as much for power under Muskrat Falls as under natural gas.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I suppose that it's the opinion of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party that you can just build Muskrat Falls at any time - it doesn't matter, just snap your fingers and it would be there. Well, that's simply not reality. The simple fact of the matter is that in Nova Scotia we have already moved up the percentage of our electricity generated by natural gas to - by next year it will be 25 per cent of our portfolio.</p>

          <from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : My question is for the Premier. In September the Premier travelled to China on a trade mission with a delegation of Canadian business leaders, bureaucrats and other premiers. Trade missions are important, especially in the tough economic times like those the NDP have brought us here in Nova Scotia. There is no disputing that, but there is also no disputing the fact that politicians and public servants must respect taxpayers and their money.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course the answer is, absolutely, but what is more is that that was not just a trade mission. I was there as the Chair of the Council of the Federation with all of the other premiers from across the country and we travelled not just with business leaders from Nova Scotia but with business leaders from across the country. We met with the senior leadership not only of the Chinese government but the business leadership throughout the areas in which we were fortunate enough to be.</p>

          <p>MR.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, it is such a shame when you see somebody reduced to these kinds of questions. The simple fact of the matter is that of course we travel so that we are able to get up, go to work, are able, in fact, to do the work that the people of Nova Scotia and, in this case the people of Canada, expect from us. Yes, that's right.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, in my very first question I acknowledged that the trips can be worthwhile and bring benefits. This isn't really about that. In 2001 the NDP member for Timberlea-Prospect complained about the then-Premier's $620 expense, which incidentally was an economy flight. In 2002 the current Finance Minister complained about a $3,700 flight by a deputy minister, to lead a delegation. In 2000 the then-NDP member for Sackville-Cobequid complained about a minister's $800 expense claim saying, "He's certainly not practising what he preaches. I think the average Nova Scotian will look at it as a bit of an excess."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure if you go back far enough you can probably dig up just about anything; I think that was 12 years ago he is talking about. The simple fact of the matter is - and I remember when there were members of the Progressive Conservative Government who would fly first class and I understood - I understand when they fly business class on very, very long trips because the simple fact of the matter is they have to be able to get up and they have to be able to work on behalf of the people right after they get there. This is not about vacations. This is about business.</p>

Today the Northside General emergency room in North Sydney is closed - and I'll table that release. Last night the emergency room at Fishermen's Memorial Hospital in Lunenburg was closed.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, it is true. It has taken a long time to clean up the mess that has been created by the former Health Ministers in the Progressive Conservative Government. But here's the good news, in the Collaborative Emergency Centres where they have been open for comparative periods of time, we have taken emergency room closures from 2,100 hours down to below 50 - and the only reason it's at 50 is because those Collaborative Emergency Centres are actually working through how staffing takes place, and we expect that they will be able to fall even lower than that.</p>

D'ENTREMONT : Well, I'm glad, Mr. Speaker, that the Premier is able to provide a statistic on how much closure we're having across the province because, to make matters worse, the Premier and the minister are failing on the commitment. In 2009, they made it a law that it would annually table an accountability report with the days that all emergency rooms in the province were closed and, of course, the reasons for those closures. The last Emergency Room Accountability Report was tabled 18 months ago - that's a far cry from an annual report.</p>

That's why currently we have paramedics all across this province who can deliver clot-busting medications in the living room of someone's house, in the bedroom of someone's home. We're continuing to ensure that health care providers can provide the emergency care to Nova Scotians.

Again, on October 7th, the headline reads that the Premier ". . . won't let shipwrecked MV Miner become a permanent fixture off Cape Breton" It goes on later in the story to say - and this is the Premier - "I'm less concerned about who has jurisdiction for it and more concerned about that fact that it gets done because we have both an inherent responsibility to protect the fishing grounds from pollution and an inherent right to protect ourselves in these kinds of circumstances." It also goes on go to say, "I don't want this to get mired in the question of who pays . . . I want to get it done." One year and 39 days later - 404 days - why is this Premier not living up to his commitment to the people in Main-&#xE0;-Dieu and surrounding area and all of Cape Breton?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the member for Cape Breton West can certainly read past press clippings. He doesn't seem to be able to read the ones from today. From today in The ChronicleHerald, I will read what was said by Amanda MacDougall, the coordinator of the Main-&#xE0;-Dieu Development Association: "We've been saying all along, again and again and again, that this wreck is the moral responsibility of the federal government. . . The province stepped up when it happened and tried to help but now they have to come up with a plan that includes the federal government . . . her group has sent countless letters to the federal government about their concerns without ever getting a response." We're doing our job. Maybe that member over there could do his and help us get through to the federal government.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, seniors are finding it more and more difficult to make ends meet under this NDP Government. While their incomes remain fixed, the cost of living continues to climb. It has been reported that one in 13 seniors living in HRM is living in poverty, and I'll table that document. The most recent HungerCount reports that over 7 per cent of all food bank clients are over the age of 65 - and I'll table that. Worst of all, power rates have increased by 30 per cent under the NDP.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what we saw with the previous governments, both the former one and the former Liberal one, was that the burden that fell on seniors continued to increase. Under our government we took the HST off home electricity - something that was opposed by the Liberal Party - in fact, campaigned against in the last election. With the poorest seniors in Nova Scotia who, under the Liberal Party, were paying income tax on GIS, I suppose you could look at it as a poor tax - this government committed to repaying every cent that those seniors paid in income tax, and you know something? We didn't just say it. We did it.</p>

Instead, this government remained silent and Nova Scotia Power was given free rein to increase power rates for our most vulnerable citizens by 6 per cent over the next two years. A letter sent to the Premier by the Seniors of Halifax County Zone 15 organizations states, "We [sic] like to request from you that there be no increases allow [sic] for the Nova Scotia Power, we have worked and retired to enjoy our lives but we keep getting all these add [sic] taxes and increases, we just can't afford."

This minister has resisted calls for a public process to aid healing and get to the bottom of what happened at the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children; the Premier has also resisted those calls. Professor Wayne MacKay, like other experts, has made it clear, there isn't a legal impediment to doing it now. He explained that a public process has a different purpose than criminal and civil court cases and it can happen at the same time.</p>

He repeated that court cases might not be over until 2020. Sadly, this means many of the people involved may no longer be living when justice is finally served. How can the NDP make people wait to get answers to get healing? We know how important it is. Despite what the Premier says, we know how important it is for people who have been abused as children to have the wrong that was done to them recognized.</p>

I want there to be no question, no question whatsoever, that I am committed to any child who has been abused. I want to also go back to the CBC interview this morning and Mr. MacKay, and I listened to that this morning. Mr. MacKay was very clear that the Minister of Justice was within his right, within the practical part of this approach, to take the steps, that I had the option to do that, and that practically you could look at that as a sound way to move forward. He was not suggesting for one minute to have the inquiry over everything else that could go on, but to weigh and measure the information and make a sound, constructive decision on how to proceed.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we should not confuse the public inquiry exercise with the exercises of justice, we should not do that. An inquiry is exactly that. It looks into broad circumstances. In fact, it can clear reputations but it can also do great damage - as I believe Mr. MacKay pointed out in his interview this morning - it can also do great damage to people's reputations. So in order to allow the actual wheels of justice to turn, allow people who are accused and the accusers to come before an independent arbiter and have their cases decided, in order to allow people to avail themselves to the due process of law in the civil courts, we allow these processes to take precedence, to take place first so in fact people can receive the justice they desire.</p>

The NDP Government continues to keep a multi-million dollar deal to buy land from Resolute secret while other important forestry organizations wait for meaningful, long-term commitments. Program funding to organizations like the Nova Forest Alliance, the Federation of Nova Scotia Woodlot Owners and the Tobeatic Research Institute, all wait for an answer from the minister on long-term funding.

Certainly we've been working with Resolute and Bowater, and all those groups that were mentioned, the MTRI, sawmillers, woodlot owners, and various stakeholders along the South Shore, we're all interested in sustainable development, in creating good jobs, in protecting workers and their families, and protecting communities.

You know, at best, this government provides some short-term funding until the end of the next year, and so it seems that if you represent independent forestry workers, or woodlot owners, your funding is year to year, but if you're IBM, Stern, or DSME, you can have an agreement that lasts a decade.</p>

As a woodlot owner, I know the value of spacing, pre-commercial thinning and replanting where necessary. We have been investing in programs for the woodlot industry; in fact, just last year we had over $2 million in silviculture programs for small and large woodlot owners.

I guess I've been really quite privileged in that I've known the gallery from the days when I was a small child being towed into that dark brick building on Coburg Road where there were a few dingy pieces - well not always dingy - but there were a few not always well-conserved pieces, even back in those days, in the dark recesses of the building, to the really very splendid old Post Office building. Again I was very privileged, in fact, when I think of it, because my former husband was the proprietor there for 14 years. I, and our children, had almost constant access to some of the more technical secrets and got to be really very familiar with the pieces of art as they came. We saw the building of the Lucite boxes, which enclosed some very precious pieces of Nova Scotia's culture and its history.</p>

This government has indicated over and over again how many jobs they have created, and they've lost over 7,000 jobs in the economy. Some 1,300 or 1,400 of those were attributed to a half a billion dollars that they've given in corporate welfare to businesses that have since closed, gone bankrupt, or whatever the case maybe, so it's a very poor investment.</p>
