As far as the various groups, we received a number of correspondences. We are listening, evaluating the situation, and we are waiting for further details from the RCMP and their investigation. There are a number of components to this matter. However, the sensitivity to it - and I want to assure the people in our gallery that we are listening and that we are hearing what you are saying.

As children, they had nowhere to turn and nobody was looking out for their best interests. We should do the right thing. With legal support saying that we can go forward at the same time that criminal and civil suits are happening, my question to the Minister of Justice is, why is the government not doing so?</p>

I want to assure anyone who has been affected to know that I personally, as a former police officer, have looked in the eyes of a child who has been abused. In fact, even the mere speaking of it here today causes me some concern from my past. I'm not going to succumb to the partisanship of the Opposition Parties to force us into a position. This requires clear discussion, listening to the community, and moving forward while respecting various processes. I want to assure all that in my role as Attorney General and as the Minister of Justice, I will give, and I am giving, deep reflection and understanding to the issues and I am hearing what you're having to say and I will continue to progress.</p>

Many times I know this government has gone over every word that I have said in this House and outside of this House on this particular issue. I said this is not to lay blame at the government's feet; they are in a position, though, to call for a public inquiry. All political Parties have been in power when this alleged abuse has happened. We have adults in our gallery today who, when they were children, nobody listened. This is our opportunity to listen to them and give them an opportunity of a full public hearing.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, there are many experts who have said that it may be 2020 before any civil action is finally settled. This has gone on far too long already and it is not acceptable to tell people like former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children to wait until 2020 to have their stories told. The government should, today, appoint an independent, qualified person to draw up the terms of reference for a proper public inquiry that can allow both the criminal and civil investigations to proceed while the healing of a public inquiry also goes on at the same time.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, in April 2011, the Department of Justice circulated a discussion paper and draft legislation to amend the Nova Scotia Limitations of Actions Act. The purpose of the exchanges was to modernize the existing Act and to bring Nova Scotia in line with the rest of the country. There was an exception however in the discussion paper as noted by Ray Wagner, a well-respected lawyer in Nova Scotia. In a submission to the Department of Justice he wrote, "There is one especially unfortunate exception: Nova Scotia's proposed legislation protects pedophiles."</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, this government and this minister do not protect pedophiles in any way. Criminal behaviour and criminals need to be held accountable for their actions. There are processes in place to address that.

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, let me help the minister. Former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children are being denied justice because of this government's unwillingness to lift the six-year limit for civil cases in this province. Every province except for Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Alberta has lifted the time limit on child sexual abuse claims. Victims of abuse are having their cases tossed because this government will not remove this limitation - the very limitation that is protecting those who have sexually abused children.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. As the Minister of Justice, I'm very committed to ensuring that all persons who are responsible for a criminal act in this province are taken to account and if there are barriers to holding people accountable for that, always open to looking at those issues. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, this government could have taken care of this problem. They put out a discussion paper. They got feedback that told them that the six-year limitation period was preventing people who had suffered abuse from being able to bring their case to the courts. Most Canadian provinces have moved that limit to 15 years and yet, for some reason, we continue to lag behind. For the minister to claim that somehow this is a new issue that I'm bringing to his attention, he knows that is not the case. He had the opportunity before to do the right thing and it's never too late to do the right thing.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are looking to this government to call a public inquiry into allegations of abuse at the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. The minister currently responsible for youth residential centres should have an interest in finding out truths and learning how our province can move on from this tragedy. A public inquiry can unearth systemic issues, right wrongs and help us heal from the ills of our past.</p>

We are acting in the best interests, we are looking at every aspect of what took place historically - and I mention again - historically. Each and every day the Department of Community Services looks at what the situation is of today and how we can improve that situation and make it better for the people of Nova Scotia. That's very important to us and that's what we do every day. Thank you.</p>

Will the Minister of Community Services please tell members of this House and those people who are counting on her government to call for a public inquiry - along with the over 1,500 people who have so far signed a petition in less than a week - why this NDP Government refuses to stand up for justice, right a wrong and call a public inquiry?</p>

The criminal and civil proceedings that the government points to will determine individual guilt or innocence. They will determine individual restitution or punishment or payment, but there are serious questions about the institutional nature of the abuse that went on at the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children, and only a public inquiry can deal with the institutional questions and the systemic questions that the people in the gallery today want to know the answers to, and that I believe all Nova Scotians want to know the answers to, so it can be assured that it will never happen again.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Earlier this month the Department of Health and Wellness issued a press release about the funding for new dialysis chairs that will help 40 patients from Tatamagouche, to Truro, to Stewiacke. In the release the member for Truro-Bible Hill explained that some patients endure a life-saving dialysis treatment three days a week, four or five hours a day. Many patients are elderly and do not have their own means of transportation or have needed to find lodgings in Halifax to receive their life-saving treatment, she said, and that's all true. I'll table that as I spoke from it, but that isn't just true of patients in the Truro-Bible Hill-Colchester area. My question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, why did government provide funding for dialysis in Colchester and East Hants, but nothing for patients living in West Hants?</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. We know that dialysis is an important service that Nova Scotians seek to gain access to. We recognize the burden that many Nova Scotians have when it comes to not only the time that is involved when you're receiving dialysis, but that travel time also is a burden. That is why we continue to invest in dialysis. We recognize the importance of satellite dialysis units across the province and I look forward to continuing to support dialysis services throughout Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, Richard LaPierre of Ellershouse needs life-saving dialysis treatment. Richard and his wife, Frances, travel from their home in Berwick three times a week to get their treatment and they've been doing this for many, many years. This couple has maxed out every means of financial support that they have. My question to the minister is, why won't the minister provide the same peace of mind to the LaPierres that he has given 40 patients in Colchester and East Hants?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, we knew that this was an area of service within the health care field that we needed to concentrate some efforts and some funding. I'm glad to say that we've invested more than $1 million looking at some of the renovations that are needed to the current dialysis units, but we've recognized the need to get out into more communities and support those Nova Scotians who are seeking services like dialysis. We will be making more announcements as we move forward as it comes to dialysis and the services that they provide Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, it's interesting that the minister talks about investments and money because the Hants Community Hospital Foundation has committed $80,000 to purchase dialysis machines for the use at Hants Community Hospital, so have others in the community come together to raise money for these machines. Despite this commitment the NDP refuses to consider expanding dialysis service to Windsor even if the machines are purchased by the foundation.</p>

We know that it has been a burden on many Nova Scotians over a number of years, especially the time taken to travel to seek these treatments. This is not something where you just receive one treatment and that's it. It's multiple days of travelling, and that's why we're continuing to invest in dialysis throughout the province.</p>

One senior engineer with HEC was offered almost 50 per cent more to switch to PROJEX. Local firms cannot compete with that kind of government interference.</p>

          <p>MR. CORBETT : Well, Mr. Speaker, the only thing I got out of that question is they don't want PROJEX here in Nova Scotia. Well this government does want them here, this government will go ahead with people who will work in this province - as he has said himself, well-paying jobs that will pay taxes, that will allow us to look after our schools, look after our hospitals, and look after the most vulnerable. That's what we're going to do.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy. Yesterday, lawyers for opponents of Muskrat Falls were in federal court arguing that the proposed project never got a full environmental review. The lawyers representing Sierra Club Canada and the Grand Riverkeepers of Labrador say that the joint federal-provincial panel did not complete the assessment, and therefore, the work can't lawfully support Ottawa's approval.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, the Muskrat Falls project is a part of our portfolio of energy sources. We're blessed here in Nova Scotia with many homegrown sources - not only hydroelectricity from our neighbouring province, which will add up to about 8 per cent to 10 per cent of our total electricity needs when it comes on-stream, but also wind, tidal, sustainable biomass, our own homegrown hydroelectricity, and even cleaner natural gas.</p>

This project will be before our Utility and Review Board to determine what is fair and just for Nova Scotians, and I'm sure they'll determine that it is the lowest, fairest rates for our province - unlike the Liberal Party, which wants to deregulate electricity and put up the rates by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Nova Scotians cannot afford that.</p>

They just had a one-track mind and all their eggs really in one basket, whereas this government does have a plan. We have a renewable electricity plan that was passed through this house in 2010. We're looking at hydroelectricity, certainly. We're looking at wind, we're looking at tidal, at sustainable biomass, clean natural gas and other sources that we're blessed with here in Nova Scotia.

Maybe he'll also read the independent international UN assessment on competition in the market, which has showed that in every jurisdiction it has been brought in, in the past years, rates have decreased.

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, in fact we have done a good number of things to try to stabilize power rates in this province. First of all, when we came to power we took the HST off home energy; that's a 10 per cent saving right off the top. We have a renewable electricity plan, we have large wind projects, we have a COMFIT project, and we've worked very hard with Efficiency Nova Scotia to save low income Nova Scotians a considerable amount on their electricity bills - something the Liberal Government wants us to do away with. We want to keep Efficiency Nova Scotia within our province.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, the Energy Minister is slipping already but it's all right because a Liberal Government is coming after the next election. You know, this is the government that added a new tax to electricity bills. This is a government that changed the regulations so that Nova Scotia Power could earn more profit off ratepayers while they were reducing energy usage. This is a government that has stood behind Nova Scotia Power, instead of ratepayers.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, what has changed is we have a government with some vision, with a goal to get the lowest, fairest power rates in Nova Scotia. A great part of that is the Lower Churchill, the Muskrat Falls project which will bring lower, stable rates for 35 years. It will hold at that rate for that length of time. It will put us in an energy loop that will allow us, for market rates, to be available to Nova Scotians and it will help reduce our greenhouse gases and provide thousands of good jobs here in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Deputy Premier. Rural Nova Scotia has felt the ill effects of the NDP and their job elimination policies more than anyone. Nova Scotia as a whole has lost 7,400 full-time jobs within the last three years. During the same time rural Nova Scotia's population has dropped by 8,200 residents. My question is, will the Deputy Premier admit that the time for study is over and it's time to take action to revive Nova Scotia's rural economy?</p>

One thing is we are going to study the rural economy, but the other side is we're doing action. I would ask him to ask one of his seatmates over there if he disagrees with what we did around NewPage and Port Hawkesbury Paper. I think that was a strong investment and a strong voice in the Strait region that we support jobs in the rural areas. If he disagrees with that, well, I don't know, but we support rural Nova Scotia.</p>

The NDP policies have failed rural Nova Scotia so badly that they are in a recession. As an example of how devastated rural Nova Scotia is, Cape Breton has an unemployment rate of 16.4 per cent, that's unacceptable.

          <p>MR. TREVOR ZINCK : Madam Speaker, I too will reiterate the comments of my colleagues. I think this is a good step that the government is making. Obviously it is responding with the domestic violence courts that we now have in place. What we have to realize in this situations is they are very traumatic for the individual who is at risk of having domestic violence brought against them or has experienced it. It's a detrimental situation for children who are involved.</p>

I think that the current Critic for the Status of Women in the Liberal Party said it very well, as have the other members in this House who have gotten up to speak on the bill, but I think what's important is that very seldom do we get the opportunity to talk about domestic violence in the Legislature, and it's a subject that I know affects all of us in our ridings.</p>

I think the question around making sure that victims know that there is a process and what that entails, the Department of Justice, certainly through their Victim Services, encounter this issue every day and counsel victims on what is available to help them. So I want to assure members that there is no point in bringing about an amendment like this without doing the follow-up to ensure that the people who need the service can get the service.</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I won't speak at length on this bill. I think members would be aware of the introduction of this bill - I think Spring 2010 - and would know the issue facing the fur industry and communities, particularly in the southwestern region of the province. This bill was really written and designed to ensure that the industry had a template for environmental protection, really, so that we wouldn't have an industry that was polluting the environment. I think the most recent amendments to that bill really were around applying an administrator for any issues of engagement between the sector and the Department of Agriculture, so that wasn't entirely left to the minister for their engagement.</p>

I did sit in on the Law Amendments Committee, as well, and from the people we heard from at the Law Amendments Committee, this bill is not going to do anything to help the kids actually in the classroom. It's taking away the voice of some of the elected officials and transferring it to the superintendent so that the superintendent has the final say and the elected officials cannot equally represent the family, the taxpayers, or the communities. From what I can see, this bill is already enacted in legislation as it is in the Education Act and it's disappointing to see that this is being debated, that the money is not actually being spent on people in the classroom. So with those few words, I'll take my seat.</p>

          <p>MR. RAMEY : My colleague here says "name two." I can name about 40. They are beautiful villages with beautiful names, names like Pleasantville and New Elm, West Dublin and Dublin Shore. I could go on and on, but I did that once before and I was accused by the member for Timberlea-Prospect of doing the Hank Snow tune "I've Been Everywhere." So I won't go through them all, but they are gorgeous communities with equally lovely people in them.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Madam Speaker, on a point of order. I'm sure the member for Lunenburg West would not want to be misleading Nova Scotians in the speech that he's giving, his statements about the comments made by both the Leader of the Official Opposition and the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party regarding PROJEX. But he may want to read allnovascotia.com today to see the letter that was submitted by Harbourside Engineering Consultants, a Nova Scotia company . . .</p>

          <p>MR. RAMEY : Thank you, Madam Speaker, for allowing me to proceed after that interlude. I think what I was saying before I was interrupted there, my point was if they can't be part of the solution, at the very least they should not be part of the problem. That's my point. (Interruptions) I'll speak to that point. It's ironic that they couldn't create jobs when they were governing and now in Opposition they want to continue to foster that culture of defeat, or whatever - I think culture of defeat, and make sure our government is fettered as we strive to develop and grow the economy of the province.</p>

First, I should point out that, as you know, the hours today were set from 12:00 noon to 6:00 p.m. It's currently 3:52 p.m. We have numerous Opposition bills that we'd be more than happy to debate this evening. In fact, I believe there are even some members who would like to speak on Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne.
