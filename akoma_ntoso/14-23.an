          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : In the 2013 television Leaders Debate during the election, the Premier told all Nova Scotians, "I can guarantee that we'll be taking $46 million off our power rates if elected . . . by removing the NDP electricity tax . . ." Well, Mr. Speaker, we now know that isn't happening because what the Premier did not tell Nova Scotians is that he is going to allow Nova Scotia Power to put that tax right back on our power bills. This is just a shell game at its worst. I'd like to ask the Premier at what point did he realize he would not be able to keep his signature election promise?</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, in that same election television debate the Premier clearly said that the Efficiency Nova Scotia fee would be "taken off our power bills and be legislated that the utility pays for that efficiency through their profits." Well, they aren't going to be paid through their profits - not at all. Oh no, we're all going to still pay that efficiency fee, it is just in another place on our power bill.

Now they are breaking their signature promise on the efficiency tax because it's not being charged to the power company, as he guaranteed Nova Scotians. It is being charged right back on our power bills. That is a fact - that is exactly what they are going to do.</p>

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, my question is also to the Premier. Prior to the election the Premier promised repeatedly that he would remove the efficiency fee from power bills and make Nova Scotia Power pay for it. As The Canadian Press stated on September 9, 2013, that the Liberals will shift the $46 million cost of funding programs run by Efficiency Nova Scotia from customers to the utility, which the now Premier said would be able to pay for programs from its annual profits.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. Not only did the Energy Minister keep our commitment to remove the efficiency tax off every power bill in this province, he went a step further and found a way to provide even more savings to Nova Scotians by providing more competition for Nova Scotia Power. There is one thing that Nova Scotians need to know: under this piece of legislation, power rates are going down on January 1st, and any way into the future, any efficiency programs, the only way that they'll be paying for them is if it drives more savings into their power bills.</p>

          <p>MR. CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, in a previous answer to the Leader of the Progressive Conservatives, the Premier said that everybody in Nova Scotia was on his side and agreed with it, but it's not so. I wonder if he contacted the consumer advocate, John Merrick, because he doesn't agree with his position. In today's allnovascotia.com, he said that for the province to take it off the bill in 2015, all they're doing is changing the way it was recovered. It's still out of the ratepayers.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know this is a difficult concept for the member of the New Democratic Party to understand, but typically, competition in the energy market - or in any market, actually - will drive down costs. It's the fundamental principle of driving competition.</p>

I'll be the first one to admit that I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but I'll take my lead from John Merrick, not the Premier, who I would say understands a bit more about this process. According to him, the power rates can defer $35 million of cost of Efficiency Nova Scotia and charge ratepayers. They could garner a rate return of 7 per cent to 9 per cent.</p>

Of course we would all like to see our power rates go down and we should all work hard to make that happen, but taking the fee off one part of our power bill and then allowing the power company to charge every last dollar of it right back on another part of our power bill is not what the Premier guaranteed.

And I know he is disappointed, quite frankly, that we've continued to drive competition in the energy market, so power rates will continue to go down under the leadership of the Minister of Energy.

It's a fact - something they opposed in Opposition, something that they said the previous government should roll back, and yet they didn't when they had the chance. And $90 million in fuel costs being deferred to a future day; now the Premier wants to add $35 million in efficiency charges deferred to a future day. Power rates are not going down. We just put it off to a future day. That is the point. What we are opposed to is a shell game where you guarantee one thing and you do the opposite.

In six short months this government has become expert at economic sleight of hand and fiscal shell games. When it comes to the Graduation Retention Rebate, Nova Scotia graduates are the big losers.

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. The answer to the question is very simple, the evidence was clear, seven years of evidence was clear that the Graduate Retention Rebate wasn't doing what it was intended to do, what its name actually says: to retain young people here in our province. For that reason we are looking for other ways to ensure that young people get the first job that they need to actually attach to the workforce, because that's what young people are telling us is really the obstacle for them staying in our province.

It's striking a balance, one of the things the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board clearly laid out. It is able to provide an opportunity for as many young Nova Scotians to be here.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. Nova Scotians, and in particular recent graduates, are perplexed about why this government decided to axe the Graduate Retention Rebate program. With one short-sighted measure, the government will save $30 million a year on the backs of our students, at a time when the Ivany commission tells us that it is crucial to support the success of young people in Nova Scotia. The elimination of the Graduate Retention Rebate program amounts to the biggest tax increase in Nova Scotia's history for the thousands of young Nova Scotians starting their careers and deciding where they want to live and work.</p>

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member opposite. As I've been saying in earlier answers to the question, there is no question at all that some people were able to enjoy and benefit from this tax credit, but it was not creating the result that it was intended to do. For that reason we've looked at the evidence, and we've listened to other people who presented us with evidence, and for that very reason we had said it from evidence-base, from seven years of looking at the stats, the evidence was clear it wasn't working and we need to invest our money strategically in the proper building blocks that will help open the doors for jobs in this province. That is what they need. They need jobs and we are introducing the Graduate to Opportunities program, among a whole raft of other ideas that were presented in the budget, to help support young people in that endeavour.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, we have a demographic problem here in Nova Scotia with more people retiring out of the labour force than young people entering it. I have figures from Statistics Canada that show an average of 500 more people stayed in the province during the years the rebate was available. My question to the minister is, when our province so desperately needs young people to stay and build their lives in Nova Scotia, why is the minister going out of her way to drive them down the road?</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, the Graduate Retention Rebate was very beneficial to boost post-secondary students in Nova Scotia. It often made the difference about where the graduates could live and pay down their debt, including their student loans. In a recent Chronicle Herald story the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board is quoted as saying, "'Are they entitled? Are they telling me they're entitled to that money?' she said of the students. 'Maybe that's what they're saying.'"</p>

Last week when the budget was handed down, students were shocked by the elimination of the Graduate Retention Rebate.

The evidence is clear, and the evidence has been provided by our own research, by Statistics Canada, by the Canada Revenue Agency's out-migration information that I just tabled a moment ago, by a number of other pre-budget submissions that we received, and studies by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, Students Nova Scotia, and the Canadian Federation of Students.</p>

Now the evidence is that that money was being distributed to someone, it doesn't strike me as being a reasonable explanation that there are people who couldn't access it.

I don't think all Nova Scotians do either, so there is nothing. I look at this and it's absolutely another Liberal flip-flop, no doubt about it. The Premier has decided it is in his best interest to maintain and control the fund and keep giving corporate bailouts. The Premier and his government have already given out $20 million, and I can table that.

The way they were done was the funding was broken down over several years.

He said, and I will table it, "There's no way to overstate the seriousness of the current situation."

          <p>HON. PAT DUNN : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians, young graduates are certainly the biggest losers in this first Liberal budget. The sudden cancellation of this Graduate Retention Rebate program is easily the biggest tax increase in our province's history. In fact, it's a 275 per cent increase in the provincial income tax for graduates.</p>

Hopefully, after a while, we'll get an explanation that actually makes a little bit of sense of what's going to work and what's not going to work for Nova Scotians, because it tends to change as this bill's been introduced, as other people have been talking about it and as we read newspaper articles about what it's supposed to do, what it's not supposed to do.

          <p>MR.

I hope that we've learned from some bad decisions and some bad dealing that we won't end up in the same place that we ended up with the last guys and gals. (Interruptions) See what happens?

          <p>You know, the minister says no, so let me just do a couple of quotes from him, and I'll table them after that, Mr. Speaker : "'In order for the government to be able to say they're not increasing anybody's rates, for that year . . .'" meaning 2016, "'. . . they're going to defer those costs,' Merrick said in an interview after the government announcement."

          <p>MR. CORBETT : Madam Speaker, I will keep my comments directly towards you and I apologize for deviating from that but this bill does not do near what the minister has said. They have neglected this, they got caught out on it in the Fall when they were going to all these marvellous things, and quite honestly, I think by bringing this bill in the House they should have kept the brakes on it. As the minister talked about unintended consequences, then he should have listened to his own conscience and not brought this forward at this time. There will be issues around rate increases and if he doesn't believe that, he's dreaming in Technicolor because that's exactly what is going to happen. This bill does not bring to Nova Scotians any certainty and indeed any efficiency.</p>

The member for Argyle-Barrington in particular said well, how can it go down by $10 million? It's unfortunate that he knows a lot about the press briefing and wasn't there where Efficiency Nova Scotia explained they will be delivering the (Interruption) where Efficiency Nova Scotia actually stated that they will be delivering the same amount of programs. The member obviously didn't hear in my initial remarks where that $10 million reduction comes from so I will just reiterate it since I guess he missed that.</p>
