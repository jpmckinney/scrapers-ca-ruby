          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I want to stand in my place and my first response to the question is that this is a very sad day. I grew up in Hants County, in Windsor, Nova Scotia, a little place called Currys Corner. I was just mentioning to the member from Hants that I think anyone who was born and raised in Hants County we either know a relative or a friend who has been employed at Minas Basin. Our first concern is for the women and the men and their families for those lost jobs.</p>

          <from>MR. MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : By failing to invest in small and medium-size businesses, and by doubling down on six large corporations, this government has failed to diversify our economy. This leaves communities that the government has tethered to those corporations in jeopardy. An essential component of sustainable economic growth is a well-diversified economy, but when the government abandons the fundamentals of economic development in order to write blank cheques to big corporations, our economy suffers. Today job losses in Hantsport are evidence that the NDP needs to focus on diversifying the economy in our province.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, we have a very serious problem with Minas Basin Pulp and Power and the minister comes up and talks about an investment in Glace Bay. The reality is that our economy is not diversified, and our rural communities are struggling to create jobs. This is another indication that our economy is not diversified in this province. The minister turns to political shots to try to make a point that makes no sense in this day and age.</p>

In Opposition, the NDP felt that the Human Resources Committee, which approves appointments to agencies, boards and commissions, was not functioning properly.

After cutting $65 million from education and $100 million from universities, after hiking taxes and fees, and after putting at risk our health and social programs, this Finance Minister still can't promise a balanced budget. Why does the minister refuse to tell Nova Scotians if she can deliver on her government's promise of a balanced budget this Spring?</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : I think there is no question our figures are different than the Minister of Finance is talking about today but what we do know is that when the budget was tabled, the estimate for 2011 pegged real gross domestic product at $30.3 billion for Nova Scotia. I said yesterday that the private analysts have downgraded our growth to 1.5 per cent and that equates to about a $60 million decrease next year. That is a significant amount of money in the economy if that is the hit. What Nova Scotians don't know is what specific effect this economic downgrade will mean to the revenues of the province, and more importantly, what this economic downgrade will mean when it comes to the NDP's cuts to education, health, and social programs.</p>

The fact of the matter remains that the Premier took the file away from the minister and is reviewing it in-house. The Premier is going to have to forgive Nova Scotians for not leaving it at that, with the Premier's record of handling their money - agreeing to Muskrat Falls without knowing how much it will cost, buying a paving machine that we don't need, bailing out large corporations with no plans for job security.</p>

What I can tell him is that with respect to the lease documents, I intend to do one better - I'm going to release all of them so that anyone who wants to have a look at them can.

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad the Premier brought up the example of the Irving shipyard bid, because it was won on the basis of a competitive tender. That's how the Government of Canada knew they got the best deal for those ships. That's exactly the problem with the Cornwallis lease. There was no tender. There was no analysis of whether buying the building would have been better than leasing the building at ten times more than the cost of buying it. There was no business sense whatsoever in deciding how to handle that building. There was just a plain old throwaway of taxpayers' money. The Irving Shipbuilding deal is a great example of what the government should have done when it comes to leasing its own space.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for the question. The film industry is a vital part of Nova Scotia and I'm proud to say that the tax credit that we have enjoyed a great deal of support from the Premier when we were in Opposition and continues to enjoy support, as does that industry. We will continue to work with the industry and look for the absolute best vehicles that we can bring to bear to support such an important industry in our province.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, the question is around the processing times for the applications for that tax credit. The industry is predictably frustrated with the government over these slow processing times. In fact, we've heard from industry representatives that this backlog of applications is due to duplication of efforts within the bureaucracy. This additional red tape is a very immediate concern for producers, investors, industry guilds, and unions within the industry, and it is important that the Finance Minister take these concerns seriously.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, there are two departments involved in the processing of support to the film industry. We have in Nova Scotia, Film Nova Scotia as well as then the process within the Department of Finance. We are working very hard across departments to understand what the concerns are from the industry and what it is we can do to facilitate a smooth processing of applications, and that analysis and those discussions are underway.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, the industry points specifically to the Department of Finance as the cause for the backlog.

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Minister of Natural Resources. Private contractors are being offered $43 to $45 a tonne for pulpwood delivered roadside by the new owner of the Port Hawkesbury mill. Now that's down from the $53 a tonne that was being paid by NewPage and it is actually less than what it costs to produce a tonne of wood.</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Certainly being a private woodlot owner myself, I know we're always interested in getting the best possible price for your product, whether its pulpwood or stud wood or logs or whatever. I can remember cutting those products in the past and selling them on the open market, on the free market and that's still true today. Somebody is cutting wood, I'm sure they're negotiating with sawmills and with pulp mills and hardwood mills, wherever it is, but in Nova Scotia, we do have a free market system.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, you know, naturally, everybody wants the best price for their product and I know we're in challenging times. Certainly, it's important now that that mill, operated by Pacific West, is open: it's providing great jobs in the Strait area and throughout Eastern Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island. There are thousands of families that now come to rely on the paycheques, from both the mill directly and indirectly.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, I hear these comments from the other side and so be it. But, anyway, Pacific West negotiated a deal with the province, which has harvesting rights of Crown land similar to the former owner, NewPage, and that means that they direct harvesting operations, maintain the roads on those lands. Private land contractors, on the other hand, have to pay stumpage, build their own roads and organize where they operate, and this all adds to the bottom line and their costs.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, of course, all companies, private individuals, all pay stumpage. Whether it's Pacific West or you're buying from a private landowner, stumpage has to be paid by those who are harvesting it. But this government has invested strongly in the Strait region. We've invested in the workers and their families and the communities in eastern Nova Scotia. We continue to invest with private woodlot owners. We have lots of programs, silviculture programs. We've invested $2 million, just recently, on silviculture treatments for small and large landowners. We've invested almost $4 million in silviculture in 2012-13. We just had a recent announcement around a private road program that was taken up very quickly. So there's lots that we're investing through our Natural Resources strategy. The path we share is investing in the workers and investing in private woodlot owners in this province.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education. We continually see from this minister what has been described as ". . . devastating errors in judgment . . ." regarding decisions around programming and funding in public education. I will table that. Parents are angry, students are losing out, and teachers are frustrated with those decisions. In fact, they demanded that she be replaced as Minister of Education on April 12, 2012, and I will table that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Speaker</from>
          <p>Here's why, Mr. Speaker : direct budget cuts to boards of $31.1 million, downloading inflationary costs to boards of $33.9 million, and by my math, that adds up to $65 million. Other poor decisions include eliminating Reading Recovery, eliminating math mentors, removing and/or adjusting negatively the class size caps, cutting funding to educational assistants, underfunding supports like school psychologists, speech pathologists, behavior specialists, and I could go on. But the most devastating of all is that there was no mention of students with special needs in the Speech from the Throne delivered in the Spring of 2012 and for the minister's reading, I will table that. Pages 19 and 20 are all that was dedicated to education and not one mention of special needs students.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Now we hear from one of those sources of the wind energy from that side of the House. (Interruptions) We're hearing now from the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage - the acting chairman, by the way, who gerrymandered the meetings that brought this around. This man is a political scientist - he spent much time telling the young people of our communities how politics worked in Nova Scotia; that's amazing. Then he takes part in a system that was working and turns it around and twists it so that it suits one Party in the House of Assembly. Shame on that individual, shame on him.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, I just want to go on the record here for a few moments. Much has been said about the boundary issue and what has happened surrounding this issue for the past number of months. I really take exception to a couple of issues here. One is the fact that the Premier continuously states, or did state, that the Law Amendments Committee decided to go to the constituency of the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Shelburne, with the committee, to discuss the concerns of the people of Shelburne and I think that's a great idea. I don't have a problem with that except - well, I have two problems; one is that the Law Amendments Committee never met and decided to go anywhere. That's number one.</p>

JIM MORTON : Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in my place tonight to address this issue and to tell you the truth, I'm pleased that the member for Victoria-The Lakes has identified issues related to poverty and the use of food banks as something to address. Of course, it's important to be concerned about food bank use, it's important to all of us in Nova Scotia, but it's also important to avoid misrepresenting both the truth and to avoid ignoring what this government has already been doing and that's, I think, what the member for Victoria-The Lakes did in his remarks. He's probably doing that and maybe that happens often because there's more interest in scoring a point than there is in looking at the facts. Maybe there's more interest in misrepresenting the truth than in working co-operatively and trying to find ways together to create a better life, better lives for (Interruptions)</p>

          <p>MR. MORTON : I guess the point that I was trying to make is that there may be more of an interest in here in scoring a point than in looking at the facts as they stand. There are problems of course, it's no secret that far too many people are struggling to make ends meet in Nova Scotia. I'm a social worker by training, I've seen this over the last 35 years, both here and in other provinces, poverty is not a problem unique to Nova Scotia, it's not a problem unique to Canada, it's not a problem unique to the western world. There are lineups at food banks, there have been for quite some time. I know the tragedy of watching, what I sometimes think of as those grey faces of people who are in those food banks.</p>

          <p>(1) Based on the Auditor General's Report, there is no quality assurance that includes key operational activities. In the Auditor General's Report, there is no plan to implement this guideline. Is it enough to say nothing has happened yet? What consequence would cause government to do things differently? I ask that the minister deliver an answer by no later than May 31, 2012.</p>

          <p>(1) The Federation of Agriculture in their Outlook 2021, entitled Homegrown Success, noted that in many other provinces and countries in which Nova Scotia farmers must compete, those provinces and countries have much better incentive programs making it even more difficult for Nova Scotia farmers to compete. One example is the potential of farm buildings being exempt from the municipal tax base. Does the minister see this as something the present government can afford to do?</p>
