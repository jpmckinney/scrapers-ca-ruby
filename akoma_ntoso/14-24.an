          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : In 2010 the Premier said of the previous government, and I quote directly from Hansard, "Nova Scotians took the New Democratic Party at their word. As in so many other instances since that election campaign, I think they may have regretted that. They've been concerned as they've hidden behind report after report to back away from commitments that they have made." I'll table that, Mr. Speaker. Well Nova Scotians can now say the same thing about the new government - his government.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the question. What has happened is that we removed the efficiency tax off every power bill in the Province of Nova Scotia. That means that Nova Scotians will save $46 million. At the same time, shareholders of Nova Scotia Power are setting aside $40 million out of shareholders' pockets to ensure that low-income Nova Scotians get an opportunity to provide retrofits and ensure that they get the efficiency programs that low-income Nova Scotians in this province deserve.</p>

That's the only bottom line - Nova Scotia Power's - that is better off today than they would have been if he had kept his guarantee.</p>

I'm sure any chartered accountant could tell you that that's a $46 million saving in the pockets of Nova Scotians. On top of that, he didn't stop there. He created a separate entity, which will continue to drive savings for Nova Scotian ratepayers.

          <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Premier. One of the central campaign promises of the Premier and his government was to amalgamate Nova Scotia's nine district health authorities into a health superboard. The Premier has been talking about his idea for years, and apparently his government is now laying the groundwork for that plan. The only problem is, no one knows what the cost of that plan is going to be. My question to the Premier is this: how much are Nova Scotians being asked to pay for the Liberal superboard in the health care system?</p>

        <speech by="#3d2afb09-46bb-45b0-8cdb-90ba97b15ed0">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to first of all congratulate the Minister of Health and Wellness who is doing a tremendous job going around this province consulting with health care providers, ensuring that communities recognize they have a role to play in the delivery of the health care system in this province. As he laid out very clearly, we will move from an administrative-focused health care function that was under the previous government to one that is patient focused. This Fall, the Minister of Health and Wellness will deliver a bill that will restructure health care in this province to ensure that the dollars we spend in health care will be directed toward the patients.</p>

          <from>MS. MACDONALD</from>
          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I agree the Minister of Health and Wellness is doing a great job concealing the cost of what the Liberal plan will be. However, we've also heard the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board say that there will be a cost to having a superboard. Just today at the Public Accounts Committee, the Deputy Minister of Health and Wellness said there will be a cost associated with creating a superboard. But no one seems to be willing to even ballpark what that cost might be.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know this might be difficult for the New Democratic Party to understand, but we have nine district health authorities in this province, nine CEOs, 30-some vice-presidents, the list goes on. We are combining those into one health authority across this province. We are providing communities with more say in their local hospitals. We're giving a greater voice to the community health authorities. I don't know how the New Democratic Party thinks that could be more expensive or unfair, by reducing nine administrations into one and allowing communities to have a little more say in the delivery of their health care.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, au contraire, there are people here who do know very well what the cost of administration is in the health care system, because it was the former government that took health care administration from above the national average in Canada to below the national average, reducing it by over 2 per cent and saving millions of dollars that went back into frontline health care - something that we will not apologize for. We did this without creating any chaos in the health care system or taking away the essential bargaining rights of workers in that system.</p>

          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. The Liberal platform indicated that their goal would be to reduce departmental spending by 1 per cent across the board, excepting of course Education and Early Childhood Development, and Health and Wellness. This is something that was heavily referenced before and after the election by the Liberal Party, and it certainly seems that this was a goal that the Liberal Party wanted Nova Scotians to be aware of.

I don't think Nova Scotians expected their goal to manifest itself in that way and I think the average Nova Scotian would expect, as by way of example, if expenses are $100 and you say you're going to reduce them by 1 per cent, Nova Scotians would expect that you're going to come in at $99 - not that they'd go from $100 to some higher number and you'd bring them somewhere in between.

So to begin with, we had a $35 million extra charge to show the university payments that had been hidden in the previous year. We reversed the $17.5 million charge that came from using a manipulated date for Community Services cheques going out. We corrected that. We showed 12 months payments (Interruption) 12 years.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : I think it's fair to say that the only thing Nova Scotians are seeing, right off the bat, is an almost $300 million deficit and a billion more in spending, an increase in our debt over the next four years. I think that's completely unfair to Nova Scotians and I'm disappointed to say, I believe the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board was Finance Critic for almost eight years - she probably should have known the operations of the government and the finances of the departments. I think it was completely disingenuous. It's a bit of a shell game to say that you are going to reduce expenses and make Nova Scotians believe that expenses will actually go down in the case that they went up.</p>

There are 46 CEOs and VPs in this province who are all under contract with the district health authorities. What we're asking is for the government to be open and transparent; they said they would be. The Premier said he would be open and transparent. There has to be a plan in place. We heard today from the deputy minister that no plan was given to her when the government came into office.

Social media sites are flooded with stories about the young families affected by the graduate tax cut. The minister continues to maintain her position that graduates are still leaving the province, but she continues to ignore the graduates who do choose to stay at home here in Nova Scotia. In a recent media interview, the minister said, "This has certainly helped us on the revenue side because it was a big cost. But we have to remember how deep in debt we are." I'll table that.

We have an obligation to provide notice, and an employer has an obligation under law in this province to provide notice. If we had knowledge that funding was going to run out, not coming in from the federal government, we had to give that notice. There was nothing to it other than we were responding to the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia when we sent those letters.</p>

          <p>Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker : the federal government transfers $100 million a year to the Province of Nova Scotia for four skills development programs.

This may come as a surprise to the member opposite who doesn't believe in the private sector in this province but the private sector has clearly told us this funding will not drive job growth in Nova Scotia, and what the federal government has also told us is if we do not implement that program, they will claw it back in two years, which in turn will undermine the very good work that is being done across this province by organizations, the very organizations that we just put money in place to ensure that they're there.</p>

We have a number of initiatives that I have just articulated that we will be moving forward on, which we believe will support the goals and aspirations articulated in the Ivany commission report and I would note that for the workers at Michelin, for workers who have been laid off, we have a suite of programs. If there is a concern in an area where jobs have been eliminated because there has been a shutdown, we have a whole division that is devoted to helping those workers find new positions. They may need some minor help. They may need some help with simply tweaking a resum&#xE9;. They may need more help with funding.

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, through you, my question is to the Premier. Yesterday, the Premier defended breaking his election promise to force Nova Scotia Power to pay for Efficiency Nova Scotia out of its own profits. Nova Scotia Power will be able to bill ratepayers directly for the cost of energy conservation programs. This is directly opposite to what the now Premier was saying during the election. As a result, many, such as the consumer advocate John Merrick, are doubtful the new Liberal energy scheme will have any positive impact on power rates in the long run. So my question, to the Premier is, yesterday he said his government did not consult with the consumer advocate during the creation of the Liberal energy scheme. Can he tell this House how many meetings his government had with Nova Scotia Power on this subject?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I didn't meet with either. I want to tell you how much confidence I have in the Minister of Energy and the work that he has been doing. Not only did he deliver on our commitment to remove the efficiency tax off every power bill in the Province of Nova Scotia to save $46 million, he actually created a program that will take $40 million out of the pockets of shareholders of Nova Scotia Power to set aside to create programs that low-income Nova Scotians will be able to avail themselves of based on income. Furthermore, he didn't stop there; he actually created a competition for Nova Scotia Power through the efficiency side. Every time they can provide a cheaper fuel source, it will drive down the cost of delivering power to Nova Scotians, which means power rates will continue to drop and improve the bottom lines of every Nova Scotian family.</p>

Now, instead of being forced to provide the $46 million annual contribution that the government had promised during the election, NSP now only has to make a $3.7 million charitable contribution. That works out to a $42.3 million profit for the energy utility. So my question to the Premier is, what offer did Nova Scotia Power executives make him that he could not refuse?</p>

At the same time, the Minister of Health and Wellness has told health care providers across this province that he will take and go and look at whether or not there are issues around safety, what are the things around timing and scheduling, but no Nova Scotian believed that should have been put into a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

The Ivany commission raised concerns about rural Nova Scotia and the need for us to act now when it comes to rural economic development. Can the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism tell members of this House what initiatives his department is working on to enhance economic development in rural Nova Scotia?</p>

I kind of question whether the members on the back benches are allowed to ask ministers any questions during caucus; nor are they allowed to make a statement during Statements by Ministers in this House of Assembly.

It recommends putting the goals in law to ensure government accountability as well.

One of the other groups that we listened to are the employers, the people who put people to work in Nova Scotia, and they told us loud and clear that it's very difficult to hire new graduates knowing that they don't have experience, their productivity in the first few months of work is not what's expected from someone who is an experienced employee. As a result of that we put together a program that is going to work with businesses who should be the ones growing our economy and putting people to work and that is at the same time going to open doors for new graduates in Nova Scotia.</p>

How can the government be at all sure their business incentive scheme will be successful when they have no idea right now how it's going to work? Yesterday the minister couldn't even tell us if both university student graduates were going to be included, or college graduates - who would be eligible? What types of businesses would qualify?

I look forward to this opportunity - or I'll take this opportunity, I guess, to inform the member opposite and perhaps all members of the House, because this isn't the only region being looked at that quarries get implemented in. I guess the long and the short of it is, the process that is followed for quarries under four hectares in size is that it allows proponents to submit the application. It gets the information that comes in, as well as a requirement for them to post and invite comments from the public.

We will continue with the replacement bed plan, but in order to meet the demands of 1,000 Nova Scotians becoming seniors every month, we have to have a very significant home care program. The Continuing Care Strategy should be available in early Fall, with the Dementia Strategy falling shortly after that.

The need to act to stop the devastation is real, and governments, industries, communities and individuals all really need to take this seriously. We all have a role to play.</p>

          <p>HON. RANDY DELOREY : Thank you for the question. I guess an earlier colleague made a comment that the proof is in the pudding. The reality is that my department - within the Department of Environment, the sustainability group is very, very active in regard to this. The work that we do as a province and the work that I do as the minister, reaching out to ensure that we have standards and regulations in this province that are second to none, to ensure we take climate change seriously and take the appropriate actions, as a government. So the proof is in the pudding, whether it is in the Budget Speech or in the actions that my department takes.</p>

I want to assure that member opposite that there was no funding for actually performing infrastructure work, as I stated earlier that came through this department. That funding that was previously announced as existed does not come through my department for infrastructure-related types of initiatives.</p>

BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, in this House the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture indicated that to impose the levy the government would not require new legislation, only changes to current regulations. My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is, given that not all industries, associations and fishers had an opportunity to vote on the proposed levy, as of yet, if particular organizations such as LFAs decide not to support the levy, will they have the opportunity to adhere to it?</p>

          <p>MR.

The other two provinces in this whole process - we're going to come across with a unified approach to lobster marketing and lobster quality, and have those tools in place. We do not have those in place. You were unable to get that in place when you were minister. We're going to work very diligently to try to get that accomplished. I understand how important the independence of fishermen are in this province, and I respect that, but at the same time we need a united voice so we can bring issues forward to the federal government that need change, not only on this issue but many more issues.</p>

          <p>MR. BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, as a former lobster fisher myself, I know nothing is more sacred to the industry than its independence. While the government has announced its intention to impose a levy, they have not stated who will manage this levy and who will collect it. My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is, will he commit to ensuring it is the lobster industry that has the control over all, I repeat all, revenues generated from the levy and not the government, if the industry decides the levy is not working, and will they have the ability to cancel it?</p>

We are going to work with those other provinces to ensure we have a united front on the levy system, how it's administered, and how it will be administered. We will ensure that we will have input from the industry at all levels, not just the fishermen, but the processors and buyers, as we move forward to market this top quality product around the world.

          <from>MS. LENORE ZANN</from>
          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Madam Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to speak to Bill No. 16, the Chief of Protocol Appointment Act. You know, when I joined government four and a half years ago, one of the very first meetings that we had as a caucus was to talk about how we were going to transition as government, as a new NDP Government, the first-ever NDP Government in Nova Scotia. I remember our Premier at the time saying we don't want to do business as usual, as the other Liberal Governments have done and other Tory Governments have done, by just cleaning house and getting rid of well-meaning and very hard-working people who are already there in government and just putting in our own people in patronage positions, because we, as the NDP, do not believe in that kind of thing. We believe in a clean playing field. That's what we believe in.</p>

Madam Speaker, it's my pleasure to rise today and speak in regard to this bill and also speak in regard to some of the things being floated around this House. One thing that's very evident is that both sides of this House like to spin a lot of propaganda and I've seen a lot spun from the other side.</p>

          <from>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE</from>
          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : I am pleased to rise in my place and speak on Bill No. 39. Nova Scotia is at an urgent crossroad. We face either a long and slow decline or a renewed and more prosperous future. With the Ivany commission we now have a plan to stop that decline. That is why I am so pleased to support this bill. Our caucus firmly believes that the Ivany commission's recommendations, including population, economic development, governance and fiscal law need to be enacted into law. The question is why the Liberal Government is sitting on their hands and are the only Party not willing to enshrine these important recommendations into law. They are too vitally important to let them fall victim to politics as usual. The Ivany report cannot be allowed to gather dust on the Premier's bookshelf.</p>
