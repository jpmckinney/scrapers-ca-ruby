        <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, I'll be brief. I thank you for your decision. The reality was you were asked to decide on a point of privilege, and I believe you decided in a wise and fair way. Again, I think you also said it in the body of your decision that this has been moved forward many times and was described to you as a precedent, and I thank you for you enlightening this House on that it was not a precedent. Thank you very much.</p>

          <from>MR. KEITH BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, families across this province are struggling to get by. With an aging population, more and more people are having to stay home to care for an elderly loved one. The expensive policies of the NDP have made life so unaffordable for seniors. Budgets are stretched so thin. Too many seniors are being forced back into the workforce. This government has made life so expensive that those, who should be enjoying their golden years, are going back to work to make ends meet.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I find it quite amusing that that comes from that side of the House, with the lack of concern over the years they directed towards seniors. We do know that seniors are a critical part of this province and we desperately care about them and that's why we're taking action. For example, the GIS, now those individuals receiving that do not have to pay provincial income tax. They could have done that. They didn't do anything like that.</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, since the minister is providing statistics and facts, I'll provide a few to her as well. Since the NDP formed government, the number of men over 65 who have had to get part-time work has more than doubled - an increase of 112.5 per cent. Also, aside from those seniors who have managed to find work, the number of seniors in the province who are looking for work, and cannot find it, has increased by 200 per cent since this NDP Government formed government.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the member opposite take a look in the mirror and the reflection would be from his federal counterparts who have done so much to create issues for seniors, driving them into poverty, not even allowing them to be able to access unemployment. What about the seniors in Cape Breton and throughout this province who are in dire straits, not because of this government that has actually invested well over $300 million, an unprecedented amount, to help the most vulnerable? The person he should be talking to is the Prime Minister of Canada, not us.</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, the minister has been very good to stand in her place and blame others for the tragedies that occur to the residents of this province. These people have worked hard their whole lives and are being forced back to work because they can't afford their bills. Many of these seniors are not only working but are the working poor. The latest HungerCount survey showed that 1,650 seniors in our province had to rely on a food bank last year. These people paid taxes their whole lives. Now this government has forced them back to work and forced many of them to food banks. Our seniors deserve so much better.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I find it very interesting that he keeps reflecting back to the HungerCount information. I don't think he read through it, because one of the things in there that was a recommendation to help seniors was with respect to the GIS, and it was this government that made the decision that seniors who are collecting GIS do not have to pay taxes anymore. We've added the recommendation that this government has done, even before that recommendation came out. So I don't know what he's standing there and talking about. He should obviously read a little bit more about all the things that we're doing in this province.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, this government announced an untendered deal with IBM today. We've seen the government write big cheques to Irving, Daewoo, Resolute, and Stern - big deals with big business. Now this government hands money to the ninth-largest corporation in the world - so far, $590 million to six large companies. This makes $690 million to seven, and 1,300 Nova Scotia layoffs so far.</p>

Do you know what that means to Nova Scotians, to taxpayers? It means that we are going to have more money. We are going to have more money because of jobs, because of the revenue that's going to be generated from those jobs.

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, if this deal was tendered, maybe the government would have learned a little bit about IBM's past. In 2005, Carlson, an international hospitality giant, decided to enter into a multi-million dollar agreement with IBM. Carlson terminated the deal early and sued IBM for $75.8 million. The suit alleges fraud, breach of contract, and breach of judiciary responsibility. So my question to the minister is, is this government confident entering into business with a company facing these allegations?</p>

          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, the question that is asked by the Leader of the Official Opposition is, of course, a very, very serious one, and we have all seen some of the stories that have been described. I would also want to point out that over the years the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children has also been the home to many people who have received assistance and help; the staff who have worked there have been concerned with the welfare and best interest of the people in their charge.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, calling for a public inquiry on these allegations is not about laying blame - it's about finding the truth. An inquiry can take place while this case is before the courts. We can be the generation that shows compassion to these Nova Scotians who have been waiting for it. There is only one person, though, who can call for a public inquiry, so my question to the Premier is, will the Premier do the right thing for the former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children and call for a public inquiry?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I can say is that I suppose there are different views of the right thing to do. I think the right thing to do is to have the proper authorities of the province, the policing investigators to go through the job that they have, to look into the allegations that are being made. I think the right thing to do is to ensure that the claimants that are making claims for compensation on their behalf and who are pursuing their appropriate legal remedies have the ability to do that to their fullest extent.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier has given us all kinds of reasons why government can't go ahead with the public inquiry. In my opinion, he has not given us a single good reason yet. None of the reasons put forward by the Premier trump the fact that these Nova Scotians deserve justice and they need this justice to heal. My question for the Premier is, again, will the Premier call for a full public inquiry?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, my previous answer, in fact, was all about justice. It is about having a process that weighs the facts, weighs the evidence, has proper investigatory mechanisms, ensures that both the complaints and any accused are treated fairly and with due process, that claims can be weighed before an impartial arbiter. Those are the very hallmarks of the system of justice that we live in. I believe that we ought to allow that to run its course and then we can decide whether or not it is appropriate that further inquiry is needed.</p>

Often in Opposition, we are called upon to oppose the government and what it does, and there are those, of course, who believe that's all there is to the job of Opposition, but sometimes our job rises above that and it is to make sure that the government, when it goes about initiative, does it in the right way and not the wrong way.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, in short the answer is simply this: there is no other partner available who could provide the impact in the Province of Nova Scotia. This is about 500 new jobs with a company that is a global leader in information technology. For the employees of the Province of Nova Scotia, they are now in the enviable position, in the best of all possible worlds, they are able to decide whether or not they want to stay with the Province of Nova Scotia, with a government that values their work, or they can choose to have a career with a global leader in information technology that can take them far beyond what the public service could offer.</p>

They were brought in very early on and in fact were, at every step, involved and this is part of the Public Service Protection Plan that we signed on.

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. Aecon Atlantic operates a shipyard in Pictou, just kilometres down the road from the government-subsidized, partially taxpayer-owned DSME Trenton facility. Aecon actually repairs ships and builds barges, direct activities in the Nova Scotia shipbuilding industry. My question to the minster is, how many vessels has Aecon Pictou Shipyard repaired in the last two years and what government assistance have they received?</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : The workforce at Aecon is 150 employees compared to less than 50 at DSME Trenton. In fact, it has done all of that work without one cent of provincial money, not one cent, but it is now facing competition from the government-subsidized DSME facility even though the Premier and the minister can't seem to figure out that they are interfering with direct competition.</p>

There was a great announcement today with respect to IBM, and there was an announcement yesterday with respect to PROJEX, for a total of 1,000 jobs.

          <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. As members know, most lobster fishermen are small-business people who each create jobs in small numbers and are struggling to get by because of high taxes, high fuel costs, and a depressed market for their product. A couple of years ago, the government - the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture and the Department of Labour and Workforce Development - gave approval to the WCB to move forward on setting up the Fisheries Safety Association of Nova Scotia. So to add to their financial burden, small fishing operators pay the same dues to the Nova Scotia Fisheries Safety Association as large seafood-processing plants do.</p>

I think all members of this Legislature know that the fishery is one of the most dangerous jobs there is in Nova Scotia, and something that we have addressed. I also want to point out that the issue that the member raised has been something close to the industry and something that this government has addressed, and this minister.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. The contract between the WCB and the Fisheries Safety Association of Nova Scotia clearly states that the WCB must have over 50 per cent support from the industry in order to proceed. The reality is that the WCB did not get sufficient approval to set up the fishery association in the first place. Fishers have paid close to $700,000 per year to the safety association, and a number of fishers have actually resigned from the association but are still being charged the fee. I have over 97 letters of resignation from fishers to the Fisheries Safety Association. I'd like to table that and maybe get a copy for the minister.</p>

          <p>MR. BELLIVEAU : To the member opposite, I want to be crystal clear on this particular topic. This particular issue has been driven by the fishing industry. It is something that we addressed early on in this mandate and something that we are committed to. We want to reassure that the safety of all fishers is something important to this government. I look forward to the consultation being completed. I also look forward to the minister's conference this particular winter. Unlike the member opposite, when he was the Minister of Fisheries, they had an opportunity to deal with this. We are taking a proactive approach and we are making the workplace safer for all fishers across Nova Scotia. Thank you for the question.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, the situation is such that government actually went out to get a consultant to look at the issue, a consultant by the name of Gilles Th&#xE9;riault. The Th&#xE9;riault report looks into the issues surrounding the Fisheries Safety Association of Nova Scotia. Like so many consultants' reports before it, the government did not release it. We can only assume that, like so many other consultants' reports before it, the minister didn't like it so he buried it somewhere.</p>

I know it's difficult for the member asking the question to understand that a forensic patient is just that - a patient, and that mental illness is a disease, not a crime. As Minister of Justice, it is my job to ensure that the rights of every citizen are protected and respected, that public safety is foremost of this government, of this minister, and to the people of Nova Scotia. Therefore, whether or not someone needs additional care or security is best put for those who have the medical responsibility in that area.

The 18 recommendations that come out of this study, this government, this minister is following and is in the process of implementing that constructive input by experts in the field. It's critical that we have processes in place that people with mental illness are reoriented back into society in a very respectful and humane manner.

Therefore it has always been my position to allow experts to provide in-depth, constructive information, well researched and well founded.

We have paramedics expanding their scope of practice beyond the traditional ambulance setting, in nursing homes, in emergency departments, in Collaborative Emergency Centres, and this is a good thing. However, like every other health care profession in this province, paramedics deserve not only to be recognized but supported with a regulatory body that implements and maintains practice standards.

It's good to see the government is attempting to do something about bullying and cyberbullying in this province, but the effects and what they're trying to do - they're not going far enough. It's unfortunate, but incidents of bullying and cyberbullying seem to be on the rise in this province. Time is passing us by, and with each passing day and nothing being done, more tragedies are occurring. The results of this behaviour can be devastating to students, to family, to schools and the general population.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise in my place today and speak to Bill No. 105, the Agriculture and Marketing Act. The amendments to this Act essentially give the province, and particularly the minister, clearer authority to respond to emerging issues and opportunities in the industry. There's no question that the minister, prior to his time in the ministerial role, was a long-time Agriculture Critic, and he recognizes and realizes that there's a need to respond on many occasions with an industry that does require that kind of flexibility, sometimes from season to season, year to year, sector to sector.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in my place today and just take a few minutes on this bill, the Agriculture and Marketing Act. I would suggest that not unlike many other bills that went through this House in years past, amendments are needed from time to time to make them better, to add to them as we grow in this case - and pardon the pun - as we grow, and we learn that this was a bill that was very effective over the last five years. We've seen good growth in this with the buy local campaigns and the IncrEDIBLE suppers and dinners and whatever we're calling it now as we go around the province. They have been very successful. Certainly in my area we see good turnouts. We see the agriculture industry involved in that and helping to support that. I know that last year in Brooklyn we had a number of different farmers bringing their products and donating them for this very supper, a very unique thing to see, something we had not seen in the past.</p>

I want to just thank the members opposite for their contribution and I just want to make it clear, this is not a "buy local" bill. As much as it might seem like an odd thing - because I think it seemed like an odd thing to me when this was first brought to my attention - you would think that when somebody becomes a minister and member of Cabinet that he actually has certain authority to do some of the things that seem to be indicated in this amendment for this piece of legislation. But people in the department, doing their due diligence, thought that this actual amendment should clarify, that it's not entirely clear that the minister actually has that authority, so we're putting that authority in this piece of legislation. My colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, actually has similar authority in the legislation that he oversees and I guess the fact that so much of the staff work in both departments that they found this and felt this is an amendment that was necessary.</p>

So probably with some tweaking - and we did have someone in who was more concerned around the business-to-business relationship in collections. When we actually explained that this was very similar to the bill that had been in in 2002, they seemed to be a little more onside in that regard. I think that whether it is related to consumer debt or business debt, for those companies who are practising good practices, they'll have no issues with where we are going here.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : I was on a bee operation that has about 1,000 and one of the things I learned there was that the income from 20 hives is equivalent to the income we get from a dairy cow. So 1,000 hives is the equivalent of a 50-milking cow herd. I thought that was quite significant, depending on the possibility of actually growing that sector of the industry, because with beehives, one of the things you don't need is a quota. So if we could get economic development that somehow matched what you can get from a 50-cow dairy herd, that to me was really significant. I had no idea that there was that correlation.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : I'm just going to take a moment, a lot has already been said. We know the importance of the bee industry in the Province of Nova Scotia. In travelling around the province and talking to the berry and fruit growers, they certainly express the need and the desire to be able to not only maintain but to improve what they're doing and we certainly support that.</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I thank the members opposite for their interventions. This would not be entirely cost recovered, we don't expect to get all of our costs back for these inspections but certainly feel that the individual operations that are big enough to need to bring in bees, the taxpayer shouldn't carry the burden of all of that inspection.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm not going to take too long either; much has already been said. We know that in talking with the industry that they are in favour of this bill. They have expressed their concerns about the regulations. We have met with them on numerous occasions. We've also had briefings from the minister's staff and we know the direction they are heading and this is an important bill for a very, very important industry that does very well in Nova Scotia. We need to make sure that we enhance that, if we are doing anything, and help it to grow and not get in the way, but in doing that, the right way is important, as we've heard. It's not all about slapping fines on people and things like that. It's about telling them and showing them and teaching them how to do it the right way, if things need to be brought in line.</p>

          <p>MR. MACKINNON : Just ask NSCC student Michaela LeBlanc, who is studying IT Web Development in Yarmouth. She says that bringing a partnership with one of the world's biggest names in IT to our region will open doors to new and bigger opportunities for people in her field. Or, Jean-Paul Deveau from Acadian Sea Plants, a person I have known for many, many years from a previous life in the fishing industry - he is already saying that using analytics is a better way of understanding Acadian's customers. Paul says having expertise like this, right here at home, will be a huge advantage for his business. Or for my friend from Cape Breton, Mathew Georghiou from MediaSpark in Cape Breton, who says that any initiative that increases the high knowledge skills and career potential of our people is welcomed news. IBM will now deliver SAP services for the province, maintaining the level of service and security Nova Scotians have come to rely on.</p>

          <p>MR. MACKINNON : Their talent and commitment is part of what attracted IBM to Nova Scotia and the job offer they'll receive from IBM will reflect that. Mr. Speaker, the 500 new employees working at IBM will earn almost $130 million over eight years, money they can spend in their communities and on making life better for their families. The province will gain more than $6 million in revenue from this project, to help pay for better health care for families and seniors, better schools for students to learn in, and better roads for shipping and receiving and products. That's something - better roads in Pictou East and better roads throughout the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

I'm going to just quote a couple - 135 the other day in Minas Basin in Hantsport; not long before that, 150 at Fundy Gypsum. And what did the government over there do?

We'll put hundreds of millions of dollars into projects and we won't even look at small business, yet they will get their picture taken in a small business for the Small Business Day that we had back there on October 20th, celebrating that with CFIB.

How many people do you think realize that? Not many but the government continues to go around and write the cheques. Where are the real jobs? If there are jobs to go along with the investment, long-term, sustainable jobs in the Province of Nova Scotia, Mr. Speaker, and they want to invest in something, okay, that probably makes good sense, but so far the announcements we're seeing aren't doing that. We've seen money invested in Cape Breton, in Port Hawkesbury, to keep a mill alive and the government boasts about that, okay, good, we got some jobs back. We haven't got them all.

They will tell you, let's get to the polls because we're going to show you, not just tell you, they're going to show Nova Scotians what they're going to do about it. They're going to stand up and take action is what they're going to do. Why?
