          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. First of all, I do want to thank the minister for the advance copy of her remarks and, of course, for many of the comments that are held within it because I think it's high time that we continue to move on the issue of midwifery in the Province of Nova Scotia. I can say I want to thank the members who were here that day when we were able to vote and move an Act Respecting Midwifery in this House of Assembly. Definitely a trail-blazing piece of legislation for us because this was something that was not on the radar for many, many years through successive governments, so it was good to be able to talk about it and to bring it forward, the profession of midwifery in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, last week the Premier came forward with a package to assist Bowater, and as part of that package there was $23.75 million to purchase land. My question to the Premier is, what conditions are in place to ensure that that $23.75 million of taxpayers' money is used to keep the mill open in Liverpool, instead of going to the parent company?</p>

They voted that 100 of their neighbours will lose their jobs, as part of this deal that the Premier of our province signed that allowed $23 million to purchase land, to leave our province and go somewhere else to secure jobs in another province. I want to know what this Premier is going to say to those 100 families who are without work. They now know that $23 million under his agreement have gone elsewhere to create employment for other Canadians.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier has said repeatedly that Bowater represents $6 million to $10 million a year in tax revenue for the province. According to the Premier's numbers, over the next five years, Bowater will generate between $30 million and $50 million. The deal announced on Friday is also worth $50 million over five years, or maybe $90 million. That means the Premier could possibly spend almost $1 million for every person who has just been laid off at Bowater. My question to the Premier is, is breaking even the best Nova Scotians can hope for on this deal or does the government expect to lose upward of $60 million over the life of this agreement?</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this government is prepared to support the 2,000 families on the South Shore who are dependent upon Bowater and upon its supply chain for their livelihood. For them, this deal is not - even though the purchase of the land is a really good thing for the province, even though supporting modernizing and making the mill more efficient is a good thing, what those families are really focused on is the fact that they will have a livelihood that will support those families for the years to come.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, if this is the Premier's idea of economic development, our province is in big trouble. When asked what Bowater had brought to the table, the Premier replied that the company had incurred multiple losses over the last number of years. There are hundreds of businesses in Nova Scotia who have lost money over the last few years under the NDP Government. My question to the Premier is, who should businesses contact in the Premier's office to get the same deal he's offered to Bowater?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, if the Leader of the Official Opposition is against assisting Bowater, he should just say that so that the people of Nova Scotia and the people of the South Shore know where he stands. The reality is that you had a company that over the last three years had lost somewhere in the vicinity of $50 million. That meant there had to be a cash infusion into that plant from the parent company. They were investing because they believed in the plant. We are doing the same thing.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, as part of the deal there is also a clause that allows the province to purchase an additional 50,000 acres of land at a price of $800 an acre. My question to the Premier is, would the Premier clarify what could trigger such a purchase, one that could cost the taxpayers of Nova Scotia an additional $40 million?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, it's a good bill. It will lead to greater economic stability. It will mean there will be employment stability. It is currently operating in six jurisdictions covering some 85 per cent of Canadians, and in fact, it covers some 15 per cent of Nova Scotians. There are decades of experience with this kind of legislation across the country and it works well.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the legislation that has been brought forward by the minister is good legislation. It will be good for both employers and employees in the province. It means that there is now a way for the resolution of a dispute to take place that doesn't end in a strike or a lockout, doesn't end in a loss of productivity, doesn't lead to a problem in our economy. So this is good legislation, and I believe that in the end we will see the clear benefit.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, we've had debate in this House and the government has been unable to tell us what labour disruptions they're trying to fix. We've had relative labour peace in this province. There has been co-operation between employers and employees when it came to settling. It's called free collective bargaining, which at one point this Party was against. This House, including government members, are hearing from constituents who are worried about their jobs and the state of the Nova Scotia economy. Major employers in this province like Michelin, Sobeys, and Clearwater say their businesses would be affected by the first contract arbitration model that the Premier is pushing through, but he will not listen.</p>

CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, in recent days we've seen job creator after job creator, representing tens of thousands of workers, come forward and urge government to abandon their job-killing legislation. One of those job creators is Sobeys. Dave Fearon, Sobeys' vice-president of human resources, when appearing before the Law Amendments Committee, called the legislation totally unnecessary. Chilling words from one of Nova Scotia's largest employers, but surely the MLAs from Pictou County - the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Energy, and the member for Pictou East - and even perhaps the member for Antigonish, have done their job and raised the serious concerns of this major employer in their region with the members of Cabinet.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Government of Nova Scotia very proudly invested $22 million into the Yarmouth ferry over a number of years.

In fact, we are, of course, working with the group in Yarmouth to see if they can find a viable service, one that would have some chance of sustainability.

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. In late October, the Nova Scotia Nurses' Union voted to adopt a common uniform for all nurses across the province. Some specialties have been excluded from the change but by and large all nurses will now be outfitted in black pants or skirts and a white blouse. The government announced that this transition will come with an estimated cost of $500,000 a year, which would be the responsibility of the district health authorities.</p>

          <p>MS.

Rape can have a devastating effect on women and their families. For many, the only way to start the healing process is through therapy and psychological counselling. Victims of sexual assault in Nova Scotia are not able to access the services they need. In fact, victims of rape in Nova Scotia can wait over six months to access counselling. The situation is dire in rural communities.</p>

We are enhancing the support services for women and families who undergo violence, but certainly we're also looking at the prevention side of things. We will shortly be launching a new strategy called Neighbours, Friends &amp; Family whereby we will raise awareness in the province, that it's everyone's responsibility when they hear about, or are told about, a case where a woman has suffered violence or is under the threat of abuse and that we all have a responsibility to bring that to the attention of the authorities, both in terms of the consequences for the abuser but also to provide interventions and support for the woman involved.

Like all Nova Scotians, they are dealing with increasing power rates, high fuel costs, and high taxes. Simply put, women's community-based services are underfunded and understaffed and when they do access funding, they can only secure funding for one year at a time making future planning extremely difficult.</p>

In fact, our department has provided money to do a pilot project so that they can document the approach they're using and that can be a model for other communities across this province.

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad the honourable member recognizes the quality and expertise of the staff we have within the Department of Natural Resources. Thank you for recognizing that. Those department staff have been working hard on a technical definition. We have the layman's definition, which as you mentioned was in the Natural Resources Strategy, the removal of all trees from an area except for those required under the wildlife or watercourse regulations.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, it's a shame that that department, which has such quality individuals doesn't have the same quality leadership. The government has a reputation for targeting small business and industries in rural Nova Scotia, and the small woodlots are no exception. The Federation of Nova Scotia Woodlot Owners, along with many other important groups, have been more than patient through this exercise, but Andrew Fedora says there really hasn't been a process and that since the launch of the Natural Resources Strategy he has seen no definite action from this government - none.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, for years and decades really in this province, we've had clear-cutting unchecked, and it's gone on under Progressive Conservative Governments for many, many years. This government now has a plan to change that. We've set a goal of 50 per cent within five years. We have an action plan. We have a Natural Resources Strategy. We're going to change it. We're not going to let it happen any longer.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday Nova Scotians learned of yet another Code Census at both the QEII and the Dartmouth General. These aren't patients clogging the emergency department because they have the sniffles. These are patients who arrived at the emergency room, were deemed sick enough to be admitted to a hospital bed, and there were no beds available.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, improving emergency care services all over the province is indeed a priority. This government has invested literally millions of dollars into emergency care services in the last two and a half years from one end of the province to the other. We are seeing significant improvements in emergency care across our province. Literally thousands of Nova Scotians have been diverted from emergency departments as a result of very strategic investments. We have a plan and we will continue to implement this plan, and we will see great improvements in the emergency care system.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, we're not in the peak of flu of season; the last time I checked there wasn't an accumulation of ice on the ground to cause an increase in the number of falls. In fact, two years ago, on September 30, 2009, when a Code Census was reported, the minister stated, and I quote, and I'll table the document when I'm finished: "I'm very concerned about this . . . Our government is concerned about it . . . We have a lack of bed capacity on the floors above the emergency room."</p>
