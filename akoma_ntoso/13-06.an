Obviously, I would have liked it to have gone another way but I want to congratulate you on your fairness and even-handedness in this approach to this matter. With great respect to the Speaker, I appreciate the swiftness with which you dealt with this and the reality of what this means to Question Period. Again, I'm disappointed it didn't go my way but I thank you for doing this in such a swift manner.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I too thank you for your decision and also for the speediness of that as well. As I said yesterday, it was an issue of a convention of this House that was changed without the full consensus of all members in the House. Again, thank you for that decision. It didn't go our way but we thank you for your impartiality in this.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I just want to take the opportunity to reiterate, as I have done with the two Opposition House Leaders, that under the instructions of our Premier, it is expected that we will have a full review of numerous matters that relate to the Legislature in the hopes of modernizing our rules, ensuring fairness on all sides, and most importantly, accountability to Nova Scotians. I do suspect that we will be coming forward together with more changes to be brought to the Legislature in the weeks and months ahead. Merci.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, everyone has been wondering if the Liberals have a plan to create jobs and it turns out they do, starting with former Liberal candidates. In other words, to hire Liberals. Clearly, the Party that dumped its former Leader, John Savage, for trying to do away with such blatant patronage is now back in power here in Nova Scotia. That's not the Party that presented itself to Nova Scotians in the recent election but it is the one we have before us today.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Premier for his answer, but unfortunately, the answer is no, he didn't follow his own fair hiring process. In the policy itself it lists positions that are allowed to be exempt from the fair hiring policy of the civil service. It lists such positions as assistant deputy ministers, CEOs, executive assistants to Cabinet Ministers, and so on. It specifically does not list the Protocol Officer, meaning that it's required that the Protocol Officer position go through the fair hiring policies of the government. Unfortunately, the Premier didn't follow his own policies. I'll table that for the benefit of the Premier and the House.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, when the Premier hired his friend to this important job, he says that he followed the government's own Fair Hiring Policy, so let's see. The Fair Hiring Policy states that ". . . members of the public must be provided with reasonable access to notification of career opportunities within the Government of Nova Scotia." So I have a simple question. Was this position advertised, and if so, will the Premier provide a copy of that advertisement to the House before the end of Question Period today?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier to the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, we hired a new Chief Protocol Officer yesterday, as was done in the past in this province. It is under the purview of the Executive Council of government to do so. We did not hire somebody into the Public Service. It has been based on a contract basis that will be renewed annually and any future government, if they so wish, can end that contract. I will also add: there is no big buyout at the end of the day.</p>

Background information and statistics were available to the public on the government Web site. For some reason this evidence can no longer be found on-line.

Number one, we don't agree that the government should be in private sector business; we shouldn't be competing with the private sector. This is a great example of that where it's a robust industry, the road builders and the paving industry here in Nova Scotia. That's no secret, Mr. Speaker. The financials - and I'm sure that the member wants to debate the numbers - I welcome that debate. I'm very familiar with the numbers that were associated with the paving plant. None of the financials, none of the numbers, none of the information supports keeping the paving plant on-line.</p>

I just answered it and he just read the question, as opposed to reacting to what I just said so if he wants to talk about the business case, we just talked about the business case. This does not drive prices down - it doesn't drive prices down, this is not how this works.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, the newly formed government has been quick to point out the flip-flops by the past government. Now that they have a chance to correct all the mistakes of the previous government, which I will admit is no small task, the government is caught in its own flip-flops. It is only 56 days into this government's mandate. One issue that the government hammered when in Opposition was the Cabinet-controlled slush fund.</p>

He said in a CBC article on May 17, 2011, "It's done in the secrecy of a cabinet room and it raises serious questions when Nova Scotians are not given an opportunity to review business plans," and he went on to say, "This is nothing more than a slush fund for cabinet ministers."

JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, despite what the government claims, of all those people they claimed to have consulted on this budget, 6,700 of them lost their full-time job in the last 12 months. Unlike the two previous gentlemen, I actually have the Statistics Canada report, seasonally adjusted, which I will table so the Premier knows: 6,700 full-time jobs lost in the last 12 months. Nova Scotians know that you cannot say that Nova Scotia is in balance when so many people lose their jobs. In this budget they project more job losses, not less in the months and years ahead.</p>

I know the minister has been in his role for only a couple of months but I know from his many years in this House that he also held the role of Health Critic and he also understands the needs of those requiring renal dialysis in this province.

          <p>HON. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I really thank the member opposite, the Health Critic, for that question. It's a very significant question. There are over 3,000 Nova Scotians who suffer from some form of kidney disease, over 500 who receive dialysis. There are three programs across Nova Scotia - one in Sydney, one in Yarmouth and of course the largest one here at the QE II. The QE II, therefore, is the guiding health authority or department that decides on what satellite communities will be established. Presently Kentville is the community that will receive the next satellite dialysis opportunity in the province. That should be in place within about 18 months and it's going to do two things and that is take pressure off the program here at the QE II as well as allow more people to stay in the Valley as opposed to commuting to Halifax.</p>

So at the present time there isn't a plan for Windsor, but looking at the demand that we will have and trying to take some pressure off the 42 beds, three shifts that go through the QE II, I am sure that there can be a review to get best guidance from the QE II as to the need and the help that may be able to be provided from other sites across the province.</p>

So what an opportunity to seek that help and to add it to straining budgets. We know that they all exist, we know things cost money, but I hope seriously that the minister will do more than take it under review, that he will look at a serious plan in the months ahead to have some discussions with those people out there as well who deserve to be treated fairly and to take those stresses off those travelling who need that renal dialysis.</p>

One of the facts that we should all know in this House about the renal program in our province is that we're actually a national leader in the number of citizens who actually receive a kidney transplant.

There are 3,900 farms in Nova Scotia and over the last four years our NDP Government has supported farmers and young farmers staying in Nova Scotia and moving to Nova Scotia.

During the past year the previous government put an additional $22 million into the home care program so we can get some sense of the growing demands that it requires. The more we research the more we hear that people want to stay in their own home and we need to put those kind of supports and helps in place so that the caregiver doesn't get burnt out and gets the kind of relief to continue what is high quality care in their own home.</p>

          <p>MR. HARRISON : Mr. Speaker, this is a third part to the problem. I know when I was in palliative care at the hospital in Truro, many people were on a wait-list for long-term care and although many seniors wish to remain in their own homes, there are instances where it's just not possible. Now, without the proper resources and the long waits, seniors are often too frail to return home once they're seen by their doctor. The Premier has said that he does not plan to honour the promise for new long-term beds. The Liberals have also not indicated whether they will live up to the remaining commitments under the original Continuing Care Strategy.</p>

As I've said previously, there is a range of frailty that our seniors are experiencing, and some need to be in a nursing home today. Maybe others, with help and support to the home, can remain there longer. Over the course of our government in office we will address those communities that are in need of nursing home replacement beds, and we will continue to take a look at some geographic areas that have no nursing home beds at the moment. It is of major concern in our province that we do first update those nursing homes that need to be replaced.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for that answer. The Bowater Mersey lands were independently valued at $120 million. The economic benefit of this land, the timber exports, and the value-added products manufactured by these lands increase that value greatly. There were over 300 jobs lost - when you consider the loss of timber into the economy, that trickles down to many, many more that have been negatively affected. So my question to the minister is, when will the lands be opened up for harvesting so the economy can start to rebuild?</p>

The Minister of Education refused to meet with them and only responded once a decision was made to close the school.

When I asked during Question Period, almost a complete year ago, April 11, 2012, about intervening in the review process for West Richmond Education Centre the minister replied, ". . . under the legislative process the school review is very clearly mandated and it is not to be interfered with by the minister.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of Bill No. 8. I listened with intent at the words given by the critic, the member for Pictou West. When you have the benefit of having sat in this Assembly for 15 years, it also gives you the benefit of remembering what life was like under former governments. I would strongly recommend to the member for Pictou West, if she has the opportunity, that she speak to the House Leader for her caucus, for example, who served under previous Progressive Conservative Governments, or even talk to some of her former Leaders, who may be able to give her some information as to what the previous Progressive Conservative Governments did when it came to the issues of economic development.</p>

There are hardwood harvesters who are very excited about this possibility and the opportunity to get in there. There were many, many people in Nova Scotia excited about this, but instead the NDP definition that he introduced basically means it isn't a clear-cut as long as there is one four-foot-tall tree every eight feet. I don't think that qualifies as not being a clear-cut in anybody's definition.</p>

I'm very pleased that the issue is at hand here today, because as members of the House know the Liberal Party had brought in a similar bill in the past. We had raised the same issue around getting in sync with the rest of the country and moving forward and really modernizing our approach to elections. In this instance, unlike the previous bill that was just debated, I think we'll find the government side of the House and the Progressive Conservative bill match - we're on the same page in this case and so I think that's a good start.</p>

The majority government said, we'll do it our way, thank you very much, and we don't need your ideas, and we don't want to really engage in anything you have to offer. I think it's a counterproductive thing to do that. I think it's negative.

So this must have been going on for a lot longer than we know, and it's just a little more time to put the school boards through that process.

          <p>MR. LARRY HARRISON : Madam Speaker, members of the House know that in 1999 the United Nations designated November 25th as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. That day was marked this year by the Transition House Association of Nova Scotia with the announcement that the first Education Bursary from the Pamela Gerhardt Endowment Fund had been awarded. The intent of the Endowment Fund is to recognize and support women who have used Transition House services, to encourage and support their efforts to further their education, and to honour their struggle in overcoming the impact and the effects of domestic violence. Going back in my own career, in 1995 - actually around 1989, I'm sorry - we had what we called the Fire in the Rose program. It was a nationally funded program, and there were five places in the country chosen to do this. It was against violence, any kind of violence, but certainly violence towards women is what we really focused on.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Madam Speaker, on December 6, 1989, a young man acting with a lethal combination of misogyny and a gun killed 14 innocent women in Montreal. Here in Nova Scotia, in Canada, and around the world, women, girls, youth, and very young children are subjected daily to many forms of violence. Sexism, bullying, abuse, cyber violence, racism, and pornography are just some examples. There is also a demand for graphic images of sexualized torture of women and children, which are obtained from users of the Internet. In fact, an incident happened here in Nova Scotia just in 2011. I refer, of course, to Raymond Lahey, the 71-year-old former bishop of the Archdiocese of Antigonish who, when caught at the airport in Ottawa, had hundreds of sexualized images of children and torture on his laptop.</p>
