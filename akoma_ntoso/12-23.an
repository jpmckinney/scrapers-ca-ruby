          <from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from>
          <p>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about concerns regarding the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans on the future of the owner/operator and fleet separation policies. These policies have been the cornerstone of the Atlantic fisheries for over 30 years. They have helped protect the independence of our coastal communities, and in the process they have helped create and maintain good jobs. That is why the DFO discussion paper, The Future of Canada's Commercial Fisheries, and its failure to address these policies have caused such a negative reaction within the fishing industry across Atlantic Canada.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise as the Fisheries Critic for the Official Opposition caucus to respond to the statement made by the minister. There's no question that as soon as the federal discussion paper on the future of our fisheries came out, our caucus reacted immediately to the concerns that were being brought to our attention. Immediately we heard from fishermen and organizations that the owner/operator and fleet separation policies were not being included as part of that discussion.</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank the minister for his advance copy of his statement today. In our caucus we made it ultimately clear that we believe in the fate of the small and independent players like those involved in the lobster, crab, and shrimp fisheries. The MFU believes that the policy is critical to the continued success of this industry, because it creates 20,000 jobs annually.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Well, there's another example of a minister over there that doesn't know what he's talking about because he's saying that the federal government is taking jobs from Cape Breton. He's saying that they were taking jobs out of Louisbourg. If he would check the facts, he would know that there is nobody losing their jobs. There are people retiring but nobody is losing their job. But that minister and that government don't take the time to get the facts straight.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, today the Utility and Review Board has stated at the Public Accounts Committee that if the Lower Churchill project falls under the control of Emera, there's nothing they can do to oversee this particular project. The Premier told this House, in the past, that this project would fall under the authority of the URB. Either the Premier doesn't know the full scope of this project or he misled this House. My question to the Premier is, which is it?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Utility and Review Board said today that the lead company and the only one speaking to them is Emera not Nova Scotia Power. He was very clear to the committee of this House that no one from Nova Scotia Power has contacted the Utility and Review Board and that they would have no oversight over that project. Maybe the Premier could stand in this House and clarify if he knows something that the chairman of the Utility and Review Board doesn't?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the only way that that project can go to the Utility and Review Board - either it's being built by Nova Scotia Power or we change the legislation. Since this government has brought forward no legislation - we have had a weak legislative agenda, it would have been nice to have a substantive piece of legislation that could have debated, but we've had a weak legislative agenda. So my question to the Premier, is he going to change the legislation or what?</p>

But there are, in fact, other ways that this project could come to the Utility and Review Board but further to that if it requires that there are regulatory change to ensure that the project comes to the Utility and Review Board we will see that that is done.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, in committee today the chair of the Public Utility Board stated clearly that they may not review the Muskrat Falls project, depending on how it is financed. That is a clear contradiction to what the Premier told all Nova Scotians prior to today. Now we hear him say that they will and so my question to the Premier why did the Premier tell Nova Scotians that it was the job of the Utility and Review Board to review that project when in fact it isn't.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know that that question was written before Question Period. Certainly now that he's had the benefit of listening to the answers to the questions that were put to the Leader of the Official Opposition, he should know that I intend to direct that that project is in fact reviewed by the Utility and Review Board, as it was always planned and expected by Nova Scotians and that is what will happen.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador has already done her job protecting the ratepayers of Newfoundland by directing their Utility and Review Board to do a cost benefit analysis of that project. An analysis, by the way, that was pretty sketchy about whether it worked for the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. Up till today, the Premier of Nova Scotia - the person who is responsible for standing up for Nova Scotian ratepayers - has failed to do the same. Only today, when he was contradicted by the chair of our Utility and Review Board does he say that he may.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party hears only conveniently what he wants to hear. We have always said that this review will be undertaken by the Utility and Review Board. In fact, there have been numerous reviews that have already come forward as a result of Newfoundland and Labrador's engagement that have talked about the benefits of the Utility and Review Board. I have told the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party numerous times that the final contract between Nova Scotia Power, Emera and Nalcor have not been finalized and until the costs are known and until it is finalized it is not possible to do the kind of review that he asks for.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it was almost a year ago that the Premier of Nova Scotia committed this province and all of the ratepayers in it to the Muskrat Falls project, aproject that everyone has hoped for. But the fact of the matter is, he does not know how much the cost of power from Muskrat Falls will be. Now we know today it is not the job of the Utility and Review Board to tell Nova Scotians how much it will cost, or even to determine whether it's affordable for Nova Scotians. It's certainly not Emera's and it's certainly not Nova Scotia Power's - it is his job.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, perhaps I'll use smaller words when I'm speaking. I have already said to the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party that what will happen is there will be a review, and it will be done by the Utility and Review Board. You can't review a project for which the costs are not yet known. The final contract is not yet known.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in 2009, prior to the election of 2009, the Premier told Nova Scotians that he would remove the HST off electricity bills to the tune of about $28 million. Following the election campaign, the Premier then told Nova Scotians he was going to introduce an NDP electricity tax, which would add $40 million to power bills across the Province of Nova Scotia. So, take a little with one hand and then give a little back. My question to the Premier is, why did the Premier fail to tell Nova Scotians that he was going to add $40 million to electricity bills across this province?</p>

We believe the shareholders of Nova Scotia Power should pay for it. Since the Premier is unwilling to recognize his own mistake and force shareholders of Nova Scotia Power to pay for the NDP electricity tax, will he at least guarantee Nova Scotians that he will freeze it and it will not continue to rise?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, earlier this week the NDP told Nova Scotians they were moving jobs from Halifax to rural Nova Scotia, including Maintenance Enforcement jobs, but it turns out that's just not the case. The fact is those 25 jobs are coming from the communities of Amherst, New Glasgow and Kentville, not Halifax. In fact, the only place that jobs are not coming from is the Department of Justice's head office on Terminal Road in Halifax. Now, my question to the Premier is, why does his government claim to be moving jobs like these from Halifax to rural Nova Scotia when in fact they're doing no such thing?</p>

There is one in Dartmouth but the government when it added up its 93 jobs included all 25 maintenance enforcement jobs and that is simply not the case.</p>

This is ridiculous and the funny thing is that they'll table quotes out of context.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, the Liberal Party has a comprehensive plan for deregulation of the electricity market that will, in fact, mean Nova Scotians will pay higher electricity tax costs. If I'm wrong then they should tell me that, but I can tell you this about that recommendation and when it was made. When that recommendation was made, the electricity profile of this province looked entirely different, and in fact the recommendation that was made at the time was to allow electricity consumers to pay a higher price, a premium, for green electricity. It would not bring prices down; in fact, for those people who chose to buy green power under that model, the price would actually be higher.</p>

If I were to say, the Premier is a job-killing mismanager of Nova Scotia's economy, everyone would know that I'm referring to the member for Cole Harbour. Can the minister finally see how seven statements in the Talbot House report make veiled suggestions of inappropriate behaviour by the well-known executive director of Talbot House of which there was only one, was wrong?</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, in the report for Talbot House there are seven different instances of veiled suggestions of inappropriate behaviour. In the Cheticamp one, of course, there is nothing like that in there. Members from this Party have stood in this House tabling highlighted excerpts from the reports, tabling the minister's own words. We even tabled enacted legislation that the minister has violated and she still doesn't seem to understand, nor her colleagues on the front benches understand that she is wrong. She sticks to the messaging. She tries desperately to divert attention away from her mistakes. She blames an official but it isn't working.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, this winter many Nova Scotians have had to turn to the Good Neighbour Energy Fund to be able to heat their homes and turn on their lights. The last day to apply for this assistance was April 30th, but the fund was depleted by April 17th and this was the second time this fund was depleted this year. This fund had never been depleted before. The fund received a top-up of $400,000 two months ago and then ran out of money again with over a week left to the program. People who needed help with their power bills were being turned away. My question is, how is it acceptable to the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations that so many Nova Scotians needed assistance paying their power bills that the fund was depleted twice this season?</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question, it's a good one. The Good Neighbour Energy Fund is not run by government. It is the generosity of the people through the government to give money to the Salvation Army that runs that fund. We made two instalments, if I can use that word, of $400,000. The initial plan was to give them $400,000 and they used that up fairly quickly; we had the capacity to offer more and we did do that. Do we like the fact that Nova Scotians find themselves in difficulty? We don't. I think the use of the fund applies more to oil than it does to electricity, but that could yet be verified. I want to say if it was possible to do more I think we would very much like to do more, but whatever we can do we try to do it.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, the increased need for the Good Neighbour Energy Fund speaks volumes about the need for this government to act to make power more affordable for Nova Scotians. Last year 1,808 families accessed this fund. This year 2,752 families had to use it, that's 944 more families that needed to use this assistance because they couldn't pay their power bills. Will the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations stand up for Nova Scotians, call on his Cabinet colleagues to break the Nova Scotia Power monopoly, and reduce the need for so many people to seek help with their power bills?</p>

The condition on which she speaks, I don't think anybody can say, I don't think she can say, is related to power rates in Nova Scotia.

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, it's not enough to keep topping up the assistance fund. Since 2001, power rates have gone up 40 per cent. The previous government did nothing to ease the burden of power rates on Nova Scotians and this government isn't doing anything either. We're not talking about power taxes; we're talking about power rates. Power rates are unmanageable, and as a result the Good Neighbour Energy Fund was depleted twice this season. Will this government do what the former government refused to do and do something, anything, to make power rates more affordable and break the monopoly of Nova Scotia Power?</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, this story gets potentially worse. You see, there is a clause in the new agreement - Article 32.23, to be exact, which I will table - which has a layoff exception. The clause states that any worker with eight years experience can't be laid off except where a layoff is beyond the control of the employer. Fire, explosions, and destruction or the breakdown of machinery are examples cited in the clause as beyond the control of the employer. Balancing the budget for this NDP Government is not.</p>

KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, in response to the NDP and their decision to tear up the municipal MOU last year, towns and municipalities are being forced into the position of raising taxes. We know that Queens Municipality has instituted a 3 per cent hike because of the NDP; Queens is not alone. The Municipality of Digby will incur $136,525 more in expenditures this year because of the decision of the NDP to tear up the MOU. This added pressure on the municipalities already struggling to keep up with added costs such as raising power costs, wastewater treatment and supports to organizations.

The situation actually has been that many municipal units have not raised their rate for their taxpayers. There is no indication that any changes to the MOU have caused increased rates for taxpayers. As far as Queens goes, I think there's some new infrastructure they're building there and that's their choice to increase the rate to help cover those costs. We are considering all Nova Scotians and all taxpayers, there's only one taxpayer for all three levels of government and so this government actually has considered their concerns. They have about $140 million surplus among the municipal units and I think they are not being penalized by this government.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, 3 per cent in Queens, an additional 3 cents on the residential tax rate in Digby, an additional 2.59 cents in both residential and commercial tax rates in the County of Colchester, this is what the minister's decision means and it adds up. The Municipality of Argyle is faced with difficult decisions around service delivery. Nova Scotians across the province are faced with paying more for less thanks to this NDP Government. My question is, will the minister reconsider his decision to tear up the MOU?</p>

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis greatly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals. Screening newborns for cystic fibrosis would have an incredible impact on both the day-to-day lives of patients and the costs associated with their care. Studies reveal there's a significant difference between those who are screened at birth and those who are diagnosed in a clinical setting.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for a very important question. I believe that there are really only a few provinces that are currently doing this particular test. We are looking at what is happening elsewhere.</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, cystic fibrosis patients are used to frequent hospital stays, on top of dealing with both intravenous antibiotics and a host of other drugs. Each year we spend over $1 million on these drugs alone. A report from the Health and Wellness Department indicates that an average of $7,443 is spent on each patient every year. In examining the total cost of care for an individual with CF, in-patient hospitalization is not factored in though it represents up to 47 per cent of the cost.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, there have been no cuts to front-line services in the Department of Health and Wellness in this province. If members of the Third Party want to sit down and examine the Health and Wellness Department's budget, the budget continues to grow and has grown by millions of dollars in each of the three years we've brought budgets forward. In fact, in this year the Health and Wellness Department's budget is growing by 2.5 per cent.</p>

          <from>MR. BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, I think it's important that the government consider newborn screening for CF as a priority as well, but they're not doing that. Cost-savings aside, the department should adopt testing solely based on the fact that cystic fibrosis patients are reported as having a better quality of life. An American study indicated that children diagnosed after undergoing newborn screening have benefited from better lung function and body mass index. In Ontario the screening program was implemented to avoid frequent infection and long-term damage to the lungs. So my final question to the minister is, can the minister explain to this House why an opportunity to save money and lives is not attractive to her government?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, with respect to screening and the cystic fibrosis issue, it's something that we will certainly examine and are examining, but the decisions that will be made with respect to investing in this will be based on the scientific information. The screening in Ontario, as I understand, is relatively new and we will take a look at what the impact is in Ontario and whether or not it, in fact, contributes to better outcomes for CF patients and has a positive financial impact on the system.</p>

Old Age Security is especially important to low-income households and these changes will have a disproportionate impact on those with little or no savings, those unable to replace OAS with some other type of employment income, and those with very physically demanding jobs.

WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, as the minister has said, there are going to be programs like Workers' Compensation, Community Services, and many others, that are going to cost the Province of Nova Scotia more money if there's a two-year gap that will have to be funded for. So my question to the minister is, has he begun to calculate the impact of those changes so that we can take that message about how detrimental it is to Nova Scotia directly back to the federal government, so that they know of our objections? So has he begun to calculate?</p>

It is a very significant policy undertaking and by way of comparison I would just remind the member that over the - in fact, over the entire time that I've been the Minister of Finance, the federal-provincial-territorial Finance Ministers have been working on a retirement income adequacy project which took an enormous amount of effort on the part of all governments. A great deal of staff time was devoted to it and, regrettably, mainly because of the federal government the issue is no longer really on the table. I think that's very regrettable.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, one of the things that concerns me, particularly, about the coming change - and I recognize it's some years off, but I think we cannot be too quick in starting to signal our concern about it. One of the big concerns is the current government's - and really, I think, the province's - interest in trades and trade training. We know that if we're going to have the jobs that are coming with the shipbuilding project, a lot of those are going to be heavy, hard construction jobs that take their toll on workers. It's harder for them to work up to 65, let alone an additional two years. The impact will be felt greatly in the trades area.</p>

We all know the value of leading by example and there would be no greater example than one which highlights a public service that is truly inclusive of all people and accurately reflects the population it serves. We all know Nova Scotia has the highest rate of disabilities in Canada, a rate which currently stands at 20 per cent.

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise on this Opposition Day to speak to Bill No. 45, the Ratepayer Protection Act. I first wanted to outline what this actual bill does encompass. The bill will require Nova Scotia Power to conduct bi-annual performance and value for money audits which will be made public, to publish estimated and actual costs on a regular basis, require public settlement meetings before any proposed general rate hike, and it will prevent millions in executive bonuses and regulatory costs being passed on to ratepayers.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Madam Speaker, I think we would all agree on one thing in the Legislature here, if we're talking about protecting ratepayers. I think we would all agree that what we're trying to do is protect them from the ever-escalating costs of power and energy.</p>

          <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. MACMASTER : They are more expensive - to construct them, to maintain them, and to replace them. In Ontario, over a five-year period, 23 per cent of the rate of increase in power bills was a result of the move toward renewable energy - moving toward it too quickly, more quickly than was economically feasible. When I say that, Madam Speaker, I think about all the people who have to pay their power bills. Imagine if your power bill for the past year is $3,000, and imagine having to pay an extra $750. That would be a 25 per cent increase. That is not making life more affordable for citizens, and I think it's important that government accepts the responsibility to think about that.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : That's what happened in Ontario, Madam Speaker. Perhaps the members opposite would like to go back to their constituency and tell their constituents that they've got this great new energy policy, which Muskrat Falls is a part of. It's a wonderful thing, and oh, by the way, it's going to cost you an extra $750 next year to pay your power bills. I think there would be a lot of moans and groans and rubbing of eyes and dissatisfaction. Much as the members hate to hear me say this right now, that's the reality of it and that has been the Ontario experience.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : To try to sum it up, I think we're ultimately debating politics and philosophy versus common sense and facts. If the members opposite feel as strongly as they do about the policies their government is bringing forward, let's turn that philosophy into facts, turn it into the numbers, show us the numbers and show yourselves the numbers. If you can prove it, then you'll feel better about what you're extolling here in this Legislature, you'll feel better about what you're telling Nova Scotians and if the members don't do it, then I would suggest to them that they don't have a very good basis in what they're putting forth.</p>

          <p>MR. MORTON : That was a government of the Progressive Conservative Party. It might be interesting, Madam Speaker, to speculate what might have been if that decision had not been taken those 20 years ago, if the government of the day, and maybe the Liberal Party of the day, had the foresight to think about how governments can actually make a difference in the lives of people. Instead, that government, as the Progressive Conservative Party so often does and as the Liberal Party seems to still do, take that peculiar position that good government is government that steps back from the interests of the people.</p>

Anyway those things happen here in the House - and in referencing the member for Kings North, we sometimes don't know all of the history and in fact forget what our stand and the position of our Parties at different points in time. I think that's a very normal and natural thing, and 20 years ago the NDP also very much thought and advocated that cheap coal out of Cape Breton, that coal was king. Coal was king 20 years ago in the world view of the NDP at that time, so we all know that times change.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Madam Speaker, development costs for renewable energy are high. We don't know what the upkeep costs are going to be. I remember back a number of years ago when they came out with hybrid cars. The costs of those cars were - and they are talking electric cars - out of reach of the average Nova Scotian, but the average Nova Scotian has to have power. To have these renewables forced on us in a manner that we can't pay is just not right. If we go with all renewables and we have no wind, how do we store that power? We have to have a battery backup and that's expensive and to replace that battery is expensive. If we're opening up renewables directly from the producer to the consumer, how do they transmit that energy? That energy has to be transmitted on power lines. Those lines are owned now by Emera or Nova Scotia Power. They're going to charge for that. We've already heard we have the second highest cost in Canada.</p>
