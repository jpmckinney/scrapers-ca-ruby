          <from>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE</from>
          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand before you and the other members of the Legislature today to share our plan to consult with Nova Scotians on the future of affordable housing in the province. Having an affordable home is fundamental to the health and well-being of families. In the past, previous governments have often focused on the wrong kinds of housing to meet the needs of people with disabilities, seniors, and families with low incomes. Worse, they didn't really have a plan for Nova Scotia families who were struggling to make ends meet.</p>

If the PROJEX deal ends up creating the promised 440 jobs for Nova Scotia, it will be good news. I say "if" because this government has made big promises and failed to live up to their job numbers.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I was asked not to introduce this person but I think a parent has to embarrass their child at one time in their life. In your gallery, Mr. Speaker, is my daughter Taylor who is a Grade 9 student at Sackville Heights Junior High in the French Immersion Program. She spent the morning at the Organ and Tissue Bank and now is spending some time here in the Legislature, so I wish everybody would give her a warm welcome. (Applause)</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. The government has a habit of over-promising and under-delivering when it comes to job targets. I sincerely hope that we are able to bring 440 Nova Scotians home. Too many of our sons and daughters have fled the province because of the government's economic mismanagement; 4,000 young Nova Scotians have left our province since the NDP have taken office. My question to the minister is, why has the government created an economy that is forcing young Nova Scotians out of our province at an accelerated rate?</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in my place and respond to that. What we are doing and what we declared when we came into government, we were going to do things differently. We were going to create employment and stop the out-migration of Nova Scotians. We've done that. We will continue to do that - 7,600 new jobs since we've been government, as opposed to 20 years of a last-place finish.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, young people need help from this government. Even though they've needed it for three years, government has sat idly by while they've left our province. Those who remain are struggling to find work. Youth face the unemployment rate in the province of almost 19 per cent, which is an increase since the NDP Government has taken office in 2009. My question to the minister is, why has this government pursued economic policies that have forced young Nova Scotians either to leave our province or to the unemployment line?</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, today the Premier announced he's giving $11.4 million in taxpayers' money to PROJEX Technologies, an engineering firm that set up in Nova Scotia last year. There are many engineering firms already established in Nova Scotia, including six that have moved here in recent years, all without financial assistance from the NDP.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, we're not giving anything to anyone. In fact, as he pointed out, PROJEX is an engineering company out of Alberta. They will come to Nova Scotia - or expand in Nova Scotia, to be more appropriate - 440 jobs, the average paycheque around $90,000 per a job. At the end of the five years, those 440 jobs will represent almost $50 million a year into the economy of Nova Scotia. That's 440 families with good jobs paying money into our economy. They're new jobs and new work. It's an export business, taking work from other places and doing it here.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#adf62df0-6616-4824-87bd-59fd0bc41914">
          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier says they are new jobs and we all wish that that was true. PROJEX is on a hiring spree right now - 20 people they've hired from Stantec, an existing Nova Scotia engineering firm; another eight they've hired from SNC-Lavalin, another existing Nova Scotia engineering firm; and they've hired engineers from AMEC/Whitman Benn, another existing Nova Scotia engineering firm, all with taxpayer incentives to move jobs from one end of Halifax to the other end of Halifax. That is not job creation. It's simply using taxpayers' money to move existing jobs around.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, this is work that this company has that is done in Alberta for Alberta companies. Now, they can either hire people Nova Scotia to go to work in Calgary and do the work or they can hire people in Halifax to do the work. The work for the other company remains with them; they can hire their own employees and, in fact, what this does is it widens the supply of engineers in the province by keeping new graduates here, by attracting back engineers from other parts of the country into Halifax. It increases the supply for the engineering community, creates 440 well-paying jobs, puts $18 million into the tax pockets of the province to be able to be spend on health, education, new roads. I wish it was stuff that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party understood.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, all the companies in Nova Scotia in a sector compete on a broad basis; they advertise and people answer those advertisements. For example, in the case of PROJEX, more than 700 people from outside the Province of Nova Scotia have already applied for jobs to come back to Nova Scotia. This particular arrangement also requires the company to hire new grads, to hire engineering graduates from the schools of engineering in the region, so that young people can actually stay in the province and get good jobs here. That is the difference between this government and the ex-government.</p>

The question is why, when Michelin does so well everywhere else, Nova Scotians, particularly those in the Annapolis Valley, are still waiting 125 days to find out why those jobs aren't coming here. In fact, if the Premier wants to look around him, 688,000 full-time jobs have been added everywhere in Canada except Nova Scotia, under his term in office, where we're down 7,400 full-time jobs.</p>

Putting that to one side, I want to point out the difference between this government's approach to the issue of bracelets and the Third Party. The Third Party believes in building jails and filling them. They believe that people who have a mental illness should be treated like criminals.

MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, the Progressive Conservative Party believes people with mental illness deserve treatment as well, but we also believe that that needs to be balanced with protection for those people and for the people who are on the street with him. Now Raymond Taavel's family is trying hard to have some good come from his tragic death. They believe that providing patients who have a history of violence with ankle bracelets should be common sense. Instead, this government wishes to provide patients with cellphones.

Balance is exactly what the Taavel family wants, they want the public and the patients protected by considering electronic monitoring, yet this government will go forward with any idea that gives them peace of mind.

In 2010, just two years ago, this government, the NDP, lowered mercury emission standards of Nova Scotia Power, and that was among the first signs Nova Scotians had that they have elected Nova Scotia Power rather than the NDP to government. At the time the NDP said the reason behind the decision to lower emission targets, despite every other province - every other province meeting their targets and having lower power bills - they said it would save money. I will table the press release where the government said it would lower the bills.</p>

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, young Nova Scotians are facing higher debt, higher costs of their higher education and fewer job prospects in the Province of Nova Scotia. There is currently a tuition policy review underway, which can see tuitions increase as a direct result of the NDP's deep cuts to universities. Students want to know where their Premier stands. So will the Premier stand up for students and prevent further tuition increases in the Province of Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I just want to start by saying - and I know that the member for Yarmouth knows - that not a single word of what he said was true. In fact, this government brought in a debt cap that actually capped the amount of debt and it was a great benefit to students by lowering the amount of debt that they have. We have invested more in student aid than any government in this province, with the exception of the advent of the student aid program.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier might be in denial but students and their families, who are paying high tuitions, aren't. The question was about tuition. Yesterday, students marched to protest the rising costs of a post-secondary education and the crushing debt load that they carry. A report released by Sun Life Financial concluded that economic uncertainty and financial strain is having a detrimental effect on mental health of young people, and I'll table that. This is a real problem which is only made worse by the dismal track record of this Premier when it comes to employment opportunities for young people. Young Nova Scotians, faced with crushing debt loads and higher unemployment rates in this province, are being forced to leave their communities to take jobs elsewhere &#x2013; primarily out West.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, so far this government has invested $90-some million in student aid and, like I said, more than has been invested at any time in the past, reducing the amount of debt that students have in this province. In addition, we are investing in good jobs for young people, for new graduates. A perfect example happened today when a co-op student from engineering stood with me at the announcement of PROJEX - 440 engineering jobs that will come to Nova Scotia that will attract exactly those kinds of students, and yet the Liberals speak out against these kinds of investments. Why? Because they are job killers.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as they would know, under our government the average tuition fees in this province are actually falling below the national average. When we came into government, the first thing that happened was that the money that was set aside by the federal government for the purposes of reducing tuition came to an end. The trust fund that was in place came to an end. So the first thing that we had to do - if we'd done nothing, the tuitions in the province would have gone up 15 to 20 per cent because that money was no longer available. So the first thing that we did was we backfilled $30 million in order to ensure that tuitions did not rise 15 to 30 per cent. Here is the ironic thing: in order to do that, we had to bring in a budget that the Liberals voted against.</p>

The Leader of the Official Opposition voted against the HST coming off of home electricity then he voted in favour of the Progressive Conservatives putting it back on. He campaigned against it twice. In the leadership debate - he would remember, I certainly do - he said taking the HST off was bad, bad public policy. Does he believe it or doesn't he? (Applause)</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. According to the most recent HungerCount report, food bank usage is up 39.3 per cent in Nova Scotia, since 2008, and I'm tabling that. As well, food banks are seeing a marked increase in users who are employed. This should be no surprise as our province is witnessing a displacement from full-time work to part-time jobs. At the same time, the Premier has handed out over $500 million - I guess $600 million now - to corporations that have laid off workers, cut wages and slashed benefits. Meanwhile, more Nova Scotians have had to rely on part-time jobs and food banks, so my question is, why are large corporations more important to the Premier than poor people?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think it's sad that these kinds of questions get asked, really. The reality is they vote against and they criticize the actual efforts that keep people working. The investments in Port Hawkesbury mean that there are 1,000 people working. If they had their way, they would have not supported Port Hawkesbury and 1,000 or 1,400 people would be out of jobs. That's because what they are doing is engaging either disingenuously in just political posturing, but you know something? I don't think so. I think the truth is the Liberals are simply job-killers.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, low income is the key factor in determining the need for food banks. Families are facing rising costs related to food, housing and energy. There are currently over 1,800 families waiting for public housing in this province. This doesn't even include the number of homeless people, nor does it reflect the number of poor families and seniors living in inadequate shelters or who have to choose between heating their homes and feeding their families.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, for years we watched while the Liberals continued to claw back income from the poorest Nova Scotians. That is just a reality. This is the same group of people who vote against increases in the minimum wage; they vote against taking the HST off children's clothing; they vote against taking the HST off children's shoes; they vote against taking the HST off necessities like home electricity. They want to see what is wrong with the programming in Nova Scotia. They only have to look back to when they were in government. The fact of the matter is we are still suffering from Liberal Governments both in this province and federally.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the Premier should mention clawback. I recently had a case where a woman couldn't access the emergency home repair program because her child tax credit pushed her over the limit, so there's enough blame to go around there.</p>

We have heard from health professionals in the area that there is no ambulance coverage in the Bridgetown area about 40 per cent of the time. They can only provide care if they are there. The ability of the patients to access emergency care 24/7 is nonexistent for the residents being served by the new collaborative emergency team, which, ironically, was developed to keep emergency rooms open 24/7.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. No question, we have one of the most state-of-the-art ambulance services - ground and air ambulance service - in North America. It's well recognized that we have a system that can react to calls throughout the province. We have a system status plan that oversees the ambulance services in Nova Scotia, so that when there are a number of calls in certain regions, those ambulances in other regions start moving around the province. It's a great system that ensures that the closest ambulance responds to the emergency closest to them. It's a long way from where we were a number of years ago. Collaborative Emergency Centres are the key to ensuring that not only nurses, but paramedics, and physicians work to their full scope of practice. I have full confidence that Collaborative Emergency Centres will meet the needs of Nova Scotians and the emergency needs of Nova Scotians.</p>

What's happening, under the present situation closing two Collaborative Emergency Centres, without those facility emergency rooms being opened, we rely on the ambulance service and the ambulance bases having ambulances there. The minister knows it's a domino effect. When something happens, the rigs move continually up the Valley. All the citizens of the Annapolis area are asking, has the minister taken this into account when he's now closing the emergency room and telling them to call 911? Where is the ambulance going to be? Has he taken that into account to make sure that we have the proper care when we need it?</p>

I can tell you on a number of occasions, and being a health care provider in the 1990s, it wasn't a good time for health care providers under a former Liberal Government. We're going to ensure that we have a system in place that meets the needs of Nova Scotians and Collaborative Emergency Centres will do that. Those nurses, those paramedics who are working in the Collaborative Emergency Centres are in contact with medical control and oversight, so they have access to a medical doctor so that they can work as a team.</p>

The Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism during Question Period stated that his government put the call centre Stream operation in Glace Bay, which at best is a misleading statement. The facts in this case are that Stream has been in Glace Bay for close to 15 years, brought there with a payroll rebate system set up by the Liberal Government in the late 1990s. I would ask the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism whether he should set this House straight and apologize to the House for misleading the House on the fact that he did not create these jobs in Cape Breton?

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Madam Speaker, it's interesting to hear the previous speaker say what the province is not getting into, but hasn't said what the province is getting into or what the province is announcing. So here we have - and the previous speaker talked about jobs going away, and I'm sure the member remembers the postcard the Premier sent to the people on the South Shore that proclaimed "Bowater's survival produces hope" and "Five-year deal brightens prospects along South Shore." I heard from a lot of people on the South Shore. I met with a lot of people who are extremely insulted by that postcard after the closure, especially when they went back and looked at what Opposition Parties talked about and pointed out the very risks and the very real possibility that that could happen with the deal the government signed.</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I don't intend to speak long as well, but I guess when I hear what the member opposite from the NDP Government had to say about the Bowater lands, it is true that it is a very valuable resource, a resource that is important to our province, and indeed, to the people of the community.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : It seems like one end of the province has one set of values and rules, but when you go to a different area of the province where we have 16 per cent unemployment, well, there's another set of rules there. Then when you have private value-added contractors who are looking to get into our forests in Cape Breton so that they can produce and build products - value-added products to the wood fibre that's there - indeed, they're told, well, you have to deal with the new pulp company.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Madam Speaker, I will retract that word and in its place I would desperately not like to see these companies come from outside and clear-cut - if we knew what the definition of clear-cut really was - the woods and the forests in the Province of Nova Scotia. Thank you.</p>
