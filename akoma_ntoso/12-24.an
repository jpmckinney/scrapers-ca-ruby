          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, a conflict of interest occurs when your obligations to a party or the greater public could be influenced or compromised by self-interests or prior commitment, competing loyalties, or your inability to be objective. Recently officials at the East Coast Forensic Centre declared a conflict of interest when it came to conducting an assessment of their patient, Mr. Denny. As a result, a professional outside our province has been tasked with the important responsibility of doing that assessment.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are still wondering what happened in the case of the death of Raymond Taavel. They believe there was a breakdown somewhere, and they would like to have answers and assurances that it won't happen again. However, the actions of this government placed hard-working DHA and government officials in a difficult position to investigate their own protocols and whether they were followed, and to assess whether they were sufficient.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. We are only one week from the last-minute settlement with the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union Local 42 and already our health system is at risk of being thrown into chaos again. The Nova Scotia Nurses' Union, which bargains for 6,000 registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurse practitioners, will be back at the bargaining table this very month.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I can tell Nova Scotians and the member opposite is that we will conduct negotiations in good faith, as we always do, and we will seek to have a resolve that meets all of those criteria. Of course, we don't want disruptions in the health care system and that is the focus of our efforts.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure that nurses feel that when they're told they can always fire some of their fellow employees if their settlement is too high is negotiating in good faith but, in any event, the fact of the matter is that the Nurses' Union wants wage parity with the nurses of the NSGEU who, as we know, got an arbitrated settlement last month of 5.1 per cent. District health authorities have already filed their business plans which include provision for a 1 per cent increase. Clearly the government is on a new collision course with the Nurses' Union in their negotiations like they were on with the NSGEU nurses.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the negotiations that took place recently were done under good management. They were purposeful and predictable. They yielded a result that allows for a settlement without what we have seen in the past in the way of huge labour disruptions. That I believe has always been the intention of government of any stripe unless the member of the Progressive Conservative Party is of the opinion that the job of government is to provoke unnecessary strikes.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier may have as an objective that there's no labour disruption but the fact of the matter is under his approach last week, last month there were 500 surgeries cancelled. There were many thousands of procedures cancelled. There was a real disruption among the health services of people who were not at the table. In my view, the job of a government is to look after those people first and that is what the Premier failed to do and in order to avoid labour disruption he agreed to a last-minute deal that he doesn't even know how much it's going to cost in the end to implement. Instead, he tells nurses that if it's too much, they can always lay off some of the nurses which would not only be cruel to the nurses who think they're about to get a raise and instead get a pink slip from his government, but also cruel to the people who rely on those nurses for important health services.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At the beginning of this week we heard the government announce they were going to be moving jobs out of HRM, across rural Nova Scotia. One of those consolidations of jobs would happen in New Waterford and I think all of us, by and large, agreed with the decision, we should be moving services closer to Nova Scotians who were going to be receiving those services. But on a question coming from the Progressive Conservative caucus yesterday, it turns out that not all those jobs are leaving HRM. Some of them are coming from rural Nova Scotia, and as you would know from yesterday, some of those are coming from Kentville, in the riding of Kings North.</p>

What he recognizes, and all members of this team recognize, is ensuring that systems change in order to keep pace with the needs of the clients of the system is an important thing to happen.

As a matter of fact, if he reads Hansard from yesterday, even his first answer said all the jobs were coming from Dartmouth when in fact that's wrong. As a matter of fact, jobs are coming from backbenchers' ridings. As you know, on this side of the House I've said many times that the Industrial Expansion Fund provides the government an opportunity to pick winners and losers.

According to the Nurses' Union, a two-nurse/one-paramedic staffing model would be safer and more appropriate.

We're certainly working with the workers and the families and the industry and the investment there is in the capital improvements for the company; it is in the energy efficiencies, and certainly an investment in the workers and in the 2,000 jobs in southwestern Nova Scotia that are saved in that area.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, those investments to improve the mill are improving a mill that by the end of July will have been closed for 11 of the 30 weeks since the government handed them $50 million. The fact is that those employees there aren't getting paid when the mill isn't working, so they've handed out $50 million without protecting the jobs, without protecting the pensions, and without ensuring that Nova Scotians work in the forests.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, we're continuing to work with the company and with the forestry contractors in southwestern Nova Scotia. Certainly downtime is not something that we want to see but it's certainly not unusual in the industry across Canada at this time, There are a number of mills that, actually, have closed or are not open at all; there are others that have taken downtime. We're going to continue to work in the best interests of the forest industry and of Resolute and the workers and their families in that area of our province.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Well, Mr. Speaker, the jobs they've protected are largely in position only because when they're not working, they're not getting paid. It's as simple as that. The deal did not protect the pensions; it didn't ensure that people work in the forests. The other thing that this deal did not do is it did nothing to diversify the Liverpool economy, to help grow the region and protect the region. So, Mr. Speaker, since the government was so focused on newsprint and its continued demand, could the minister please tell me what he's done to increase the demand for newsprint in the world?</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, certainly the Resolute facility in southwestern Nova Scotia, in the Liverpool area, is an important component of our economy in that area. My understanding is that the pensions that the honourable member speaks about are fully funded, so I'm not sure where he's getting that information from. Anyway, the forest industry is important to our economy, it's important to southwestern Nova Scotia and we're going to continue to work with the industry and the workers, to make sure it's sustainable well into the future.</p>

Time and time again, the minister has told members of this House that she posted a review of Talbot House on her department's Web site because she received a FOIPOP from the media.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, during Budget Estimates, the Minister of Health and Wellness reported that the wait list for long-term care beds now exceeds 1,800 people. The wait list has doubled since the introduction of the Continuing Care Strategy and increased by nearly 400 since this government took power. Investing in home care is a good thing, but not every senior in this province can take advantage of those services. An internal report by the department, entitled Removing Barriers in Accessing Long Term Care, shows that 1,162 of the people added to the wait list in 2009-10 lived in areas with no publicly-funded home care available.</p>

It is now 2012 and the latest accountability from the Department of Health and Wellness shows that only 618 strategy beds have been completed. In Budget Estimates the minister indicated that no new beds would be tendered this year and likely none next year. People in areas of this province are waiting up to 400 days to be placed in a nursing home and up to four months for home care, this puts incredible stress on family members. My question to the minister is, how long does the Minister of Health and Wellness think it's appropriate for a family to wait and can she tell Nova Scotians 400 days is okay?</p>

I was in Cape Breton not that long ago and I had an opportunity to speak with John Malcom, the CEO of the district health authority. He was telling me that the devolution of long-term care to the DHAs has resulted in much faster placement for people from the district health authority into long-term care. We're seeing great improvements. I want to tell the members that the long-term care sector has signed service agreements with all the DHAs all over the province.

By 2036 the number of Nova Scotians over 85 is expected to have doubled, but this government is doing very little to prepare.

If that member would like a litany of what the programs are that we've introduced, I'll take him through that litany very easily. We've put paramedics into long-term care so that seniors don't have to go to the emergency department and we're recognized across Canada as being a leader in the best practices in that regard. We introduced a Caregiver Benefit that ensures that seniors' caregivers, taking care of seniors at home, have some small respite for that. We have frozen the Pharmacare premiums for seniors in their drug plans and we've lowered the cost of generic drugs for seniors. We have done, in three short years, more than that government did in the 10 years that they were in power.</p>

The RCMP ended up being on scene, so there are a lot of things going on. My question to the minister is, what role is he playing to try to get tempers in this issue to calm down just a little bit?</p>

First of all, I can tell you within, almost to the minute, that all the parties are meeting as we speak in southwest Nova Scotia.

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I think the whole point of the change that I talked about was to make that process flow more easily. Something that the member may not recognize but certainly the cap on assessment has reduced the number of appeals that come forward. It's quite predictable, you know, people's assessments. Also, one of the complaints I heard, and actually heard as an MLA from one of my constituents, was the issue - once he had heard back from PVSC and they denied his appeal, his ability to appeal that decision was seven days. If that happens over a weekend, then the days of the weekend are included in the seven and so we felt that additional time was necessary.</p>

We know that Robert Chisholm is working very hard for his constituents and I believe he was just appointed as the Fisheries Critic for the Official Opposition in Ottawa. I ask the members to give him a warm welcome. (Applause)</p>

          <from>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER</from>
          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise in this continuing discussion on energy issues. You know, in the past week, and, in fact, in other sessions, we repeatedly asked the Minister of Energy very directly - the media also has asked the Minister of Energy and the Premier very directly - whether he supports the inclusion of bonuses in the rates paid by Nova Scotia Power's shareholders. Repeatedly he has refused to say that he does not think they should be included &#x2013; refused. It's a simple thing and the only reason to avoid it, of course, is if the minister believes that ratepayers should be stuck with the costs of the bonuses of the executives of Nova Scotia Power, and that's a shame.</p>

          <p>MR. BRIAN SKABAR : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's my pleasure today to rise and speak to the resolution that the NDP Government has repeatedly chosen Nova Scotia Power shareholders over ratepayers. I'm here to stand up to say that this government has never chosen Nova Scotia Power over ratepayers. Of all the things the Official Opposition has ever said about this government - be they based on fact or fiction - this is the lowest, most mean-spirited, hurtful statement, that we are following that tradition of the Progressive Conservatives in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise tonight to talk about the affordability of electricity rates. The rates as we have seen in this province over the last couple of years are on the rise. It seems to us like the government is taking the side of Nova Scotia Power over the ratepayers. If they were taking their side over the ratepayers, they would look at more stability in the rates now instead of being worried about what's going to happen in the future at the cost of development now.</p>
