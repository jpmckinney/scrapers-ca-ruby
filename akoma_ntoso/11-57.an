        <from>HON. MANNING MACDONALD</from>
        <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your ruling on that matter. Actually what happened there was the move to change the rules was done without the committee approving it, and the move to change back the rules was also done without the committee approving it. So I would have had to do one of two things, either do what I did yesterday or wait until today and to it. So, anyway, your ruling is okay and I appreciate the large amount of time you must have taken to come to that conclusion. Thank you.</p>

        <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Quite simply, we do accept your ruling on this one, but I think for the future we would like to be able to see a reasonable amount of time, a reasonable amount of notice, when it comes to some changes to committees as they go along. So if, in your Chair, you could make sure that committee chairmen are aware of making sure that decent notice is given to all members, including the people who will be presenting at them, I think everything will be fine.</p>

We have in our gallery - and if you don't mind standing when I say your name, I would appreciate that - Connie Miller, the executive director; Carole Thompson, president; Karen L'Oiseau, the award officer; and Don Todd, member of the board of regents and past president. Rick Powell is the honorary counsel, but I don't think he's here. Hopefully he'll show up later. I think I have all the people who are here representing the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Program, and I do ask the House to give them a warm welcome. (Applause)</p>

This year about 90 schools across the province are hosting international students, and I'm pleased that they have the opportunity to learn alongside our youth.

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : On November 3rd, I asked the Premier to reconsider first contract arbitration. When I said that Michelin warned the Premier that the introduction of FCA in Nova Scotia would affect future investment in the province, the Premier laughed it off and said no such thing was ever said. Mr. Speaker, we know that that's not true. The president of Michelin Canada clearly stated that introduction of first contract arbitration would affect future investment in Nova Scotia. When asked if this position was made clear to the Premier, the president of Michelin clearly said yes.</p>

Furthermore, the member opposite would know that Mr. LeBlanc came in last night; I think I have a good relationship with him and I have a good relationship with George Sutherland. Mr. LeBlanc did not meet with me; in fact, I met with George Sutherland, and Mr. LeBlanc pointed out that those meetings and the things that they came to convey to us are done to ensure that we are fully aware of the positions that Michelin takes with respect to various factors in investment, but also in other matters that they have that are of concern to them.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, Mr. LeBlanc made it very clear that when the Premier went down to visit the Michelin headquarters in the United States he did not bring up first contract arbitration. Mr. LeBlanc also made it very clear that when Michelin heard tell that first contract arbitration was being introduced in this province, they told our Premier that it would affect future investment in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, again, I did no such thing. Mr. LeBlanc was here last night at the Law Amendments Committee and he made his view clear for everyone to hear. We encourage people who have views to share to come to the Law Amendments Committee. The reality is that Michelin has been a good corporate citizen in this province, we've worked with them. They've been here for many, many years and, of course, we will continue to do that.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, let's continue down this fact-finding exercise that we so sadly find ourselves engaging in today. On November 3rd, I asked the Premier about his meeting with Michelin and whether they told him that first contract arbitration would put a chill on the investment climate in this province and that they would consider holding back on future investment if he went forward with his plan. The Premier replied, and Hansard records, " . . . no such thing was said."</p>

They told us the budget was balanced.

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, on May 20, 2009 on the front page of The ChronicleHerald, the Premier is quoted as stating, "We're not going to raise taxes." I'd like to table that article as well. That's not in a pamphlet; it's in The ChronicleHerald. This was said in response to a question at the Leaders' debate where he was asked under what circumstances an NDP Government would raise taxes. His answer was definitive - it says, "We're not going to raise taxes." My question to the Premier is, does the Premier deny that he made that promise in the May, 2009 campaign?</p>

That's the question. That's the action that we're looking for. That's what we've seen and that's what Nova Scotians are feeling every day. In addition to that, we know that the promise or commitment was made, and at the same time, in the 2010-11 provincial budget, there was a tax hike. I'll be happy to table, as well, the budget bulletin for that year. It shows a two percentage-point increase in the HST.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what we did was we undertook the necessary measures to make sure that the province gets back to balance. Unfortunately, because of what can only be thought of as misrepresentations as to the financial health of the province, what we found when we came to office, as was accurately portrayed in the Deloitte Report, is a substantial structural deficit. There are choices, of course, and I've never heard the Leader of the Official Opposition or any Opposition members saying that what they would have liked to have seen is much deeper cuts to the Department of Health, much deeper cuts to education, higher debt loaded onto the backs of Nova Scotians. So, which is it, Mr. Speaker?</p>

WHALEN : It's interesting that the Premier of this province says that he didn't know, during the election, what the state of the provincial budget was all about, what our finances looked like. It's interesting to note that because during that election and during the very same debate, the Leader of the Liberal Party said we couldn't say because we knew it was bad. We didn't promise not to raise taxes. That was cheap. (Interruptions) We knew that and you could have asked your own Minister of Finance - pardon me, the Premier should have asked his own Minister of Finance who, at the time, was the critic, and that critic knew full well that the province's budget was in trouble (Interruption).

I just want to remind people that we are fully convinced, based on experience across Canada - 85 per cent of Canadian workers are already covered under first contract - that this proposed legislation is something that's going to help stabilize the economy. It is only meant - and everyone recognizes that - for the very few circumstances when the two parties cannot sit down around a negotiating table and reach a satisfactory conclusion.

I wanted to know why he cut the two positions and it's worth noting the two positions are still noted on the minister's Website as being active when he has fired those two people. Furthermore, the minister just talked about, or I think he talked about, how important he thinks the Christmas tree industry is and yet he didn't even consult with the council before the positions were eliminated. They were shocked, and I'm sure the minister has seen their statements on the issue; they feel like they were side-swiped. The minister cut the two positions and didn't even tell the Christmas tree association in advance, so why he would think that they believe that he thinks the Christmas tree industry is important is beyond me. So, why did the department not provide any indication to the Christmas Tree Council of Nova Scotia, and the employees that the NDP caused to be fired, that these cuts were happening?</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, residents in Richmond County in the Strait area are looking for answers after five separate power outages took place yesterday. Schools were cancelled, meals were ruined and everyone was left frustrated. Power outages also took place earlier in the week, all at a time when the weather was favourable for this time of the year. Yet this week, residents in Richmond County, and all Nova Scotians, learn that they are expected to pay an additional 6.1 per cent on their power bills as of January 1, 2012. So my question is, will the Premier explain to the residents of Richmond County why they should pay an additional 6.1 per cent to Nova Scotia Power in the face of such poor service?</p>

While Nova Scotians understand that power outages may occur in storms, it's hard to justify the repeated power outages that took place yesterday and earlier this week in Richmond County. Residents are rightfully asking, if repeated outages are taking place in mild weather, what are they to expect once winter fully sets in? The response from this NDP Government is to hide behind the Utility and Review Board while Nova Scotians are asked to pay an additional 6.1 per cent for such poor, unreliable service.</p>

There was one point that I had a chance yesterday to speak to the minister after the bill was introduced, and it was with regard to the committee and the board, as it currently sits today, and what the idea is moving forward. I just expressed concerns that I think would be quite relevant with regard to ad hoc committees, that they were balanced. That's what he assured me would take place, with experts in the field and coming from a variety of different backgrounds - that is at least our hope - that would be relevant to the particular case before them.

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, I'm going to be very brief on Bill No. 118, the Motor Vehicle Act, which the minister has introduced. It appears there are some very positive things in this, but the one thing that I see that is most positive is the appeal process for a decision made by the Registrar. The minister knows of one case that I've worked on and he's worked on that, indeed, that would have probably solved the problem, or at least solved the issue. I'm pleased to see that the minister has brought this amendment forward.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, you know, we have before us here this bill from the government that really is empowering the NSLC with, you know - and let's remember that the NSLC is a retailer. That's its primary purpose. It's a retailer and if their primary purpose is to ensure that there is safe and responsible drinking, I don't think their concern would be with small-business people who allow you to brew your own wine and beer on premise.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : That's right. Hopefully the minister will speak when he closes because he has avoided the issue; he is speaking in circles about any illegal activity can now be acted on faster and more efficiently. Well, I see that as a very punitive measure that he's talking about to crack down on a legitimate small business, and not just one but one that's in many of our ridings. I know there's a Wine Kitz store in the valley, I believe in New Minas, so maybe the member that represents New Minas will be interested in that. There's one in New Glasgow that has been offering this service, to let people come in and brew their product in the store. It's your product, you own it; you simply leave it in their store because they have space. You handle it, you come back yourself and bottle it, it's your batch of wine or beer. That's how the process works, and it's perfectly legal in New Brunswick, in Prince Edward Island, in British Columbia. For more than 20 years it's been legal in Ontario and it has done nothing to hurt the bottom line of the Ontario Liquor Commission.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Yes, that's right, and they're going to buy more of that wine from the NSLC as well. It's really just part of that continuum of learning about wine, because people don't usually start drinking wines until they get to a certain age or they have a little bit more money. So it's not something that's threatening. It does not threaten the industry, and again, who is NSLC to tell us that this is a threat to the wineries of the province? Wouldn't that be Economic and Rural Development and Tourism's job? Perhaps the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, if he felt there was a threat, would write a letter or let us know if this has some impact on the economic development (Interruptions)</p>

I think it's right that people have the opportunity to come and speak and let us know when they see a government that has done an about-face and has tried to actually harm small business, not only bringing in more regulation and more difficulty in running a business but actually stopping something that is not harmful, that is supported by the public as we can see from one small store coming up with hundreds of signatures. We can see that for the member for Halifax Clayton Park, myself, saying that in my riding I know so many people who like that service because they don't have the room to take those kits home, because they don't have the strength to mix them up and handle the heavy product themselves.</p>

Do you know why they can't make it anymore? Two per cent of their total income is now gone in HST, gone. Add to the increase in income tax with bracket creep, that this government has not eliminated, and that's more money gone out of your cheque, more money gone. If you buy any kind of alcohol, beer, wine or anything at all, that has gone up in price, so that reduces your disposable income.</p>

The retail operation is the part of the Liquor Corporation with which the general public is most familiar, but it is not in any way the only thing that the Liquor Corporation does.</p>

This bill broadens the minister's ability to audit the performance of school boards and increase their accountability. According to most, the proposed changes are all to do with running the school boards' finances and operations, but it also gives the minister the ability to, in Clause (2) " . . . from time to time, appoint one or more persons to . . . (b) inquire into or investigate any school board matter related to . . . (ii) the school board's administrative affairs, (iii) the health, safety or educational welfare of the students at a school, or (iv) any other matter connected with the organization, management, administration or operation of the school board."</p>

The power should be there for the minister to act and to be able to order a review of that board to ensure it's being accountable to the community it serves. As I made clear in the debate, I see this legislation essentially as a diagnostic mechanism. It will help and support boards to regularly monitor and improve governance practices and prevent issues from festering and going unattended.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure that I rise to talk about this very serious concern that we have in the province, and 10 minutes isn't really long enough to discuss it.</p>

          <from>MR. JIM MORTON</from>
          <p>MR. JIM MORTON : I'm pleased to stand to speak to the resolution that was put forward this evening by the member for Dartmouth East. Although I don't think I'll dignify the resolution by reading it, however, it uses words like "misleading" and "inaction". When I read the resolution it made me think again of the expression used by my colleague, the member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, the other day, more of that fog of negativity.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, the honourable member opposite talked about electing 31 members in this Legislature in the last general election. Well, they elected those members on promises not to raise taxes, keep the ERs open and numerous other promises that they haven't kept.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : On CBC, he said, we will balance the budget in the first full year of government. On CTV, next he said, next year we will balance the books. Well, we will see the NDP's fourth budget this Spring and it won't be balanced.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : No, I said better, should have said bitter. But with job losses in the thousands, higher taxes, higher power rates and the fastest rising cost of living in Canada, life is not better for today's families.</p>
