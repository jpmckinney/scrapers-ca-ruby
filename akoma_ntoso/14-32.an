          <p>HON. JOANNE BERNARD : Mr. Speaker, earlier this month the Premier proclaimed April as Sexual Assault Awareness Month, 2014, in Nova Scotia. On April 1st I read a statement in this House where I challenged all Nova Scotians, and my MLA colleagues, to help raise awareness about sexualized violence and sexual assault, and not to be a bystander.</p>

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for providing me with a copy of her statement earlier today. When the minister read her original statement about Sexual Assault Awareness Month I said that this is an issue that should be addressed 365 days a year, and I am pleased that all MLAs are wearing denim ribbons in support of sexual assault and rape survivors. Denim Day is an accessible way that everyone can raise awareness about sexual assault and sexual violence - everyone has a pair of jeans; everyone can take a stand against sexual violence.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Today Nova Scotians learned about another broken Liberal promise, Mr. Speaker. It now appears that we will simply be replacing the old NDP chequebook with a new Liberal one that comes with a fancy co-signer. In fact, instead of one Cabinet slush fund, we'll now have two.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I have said it before, and I'll say it again: it doesn't take an accountant to know that when it comes to Liberal promises you have to read the fine print. The current version of the Liberal slush fund is far from what was advertised in the election last Fall, and that's why Nova Scotians are so frustrated to see more of their hard-earned tax dollars being given away to large companies. They've seen bailout after bailout, forgivable loans, and grants to business. Now we have a new government, and we have a whole new category called "contributions to business," so I'd like to ask the Premier, can he explain how his contributions are any different than NDP bailouts?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, one of the things that, through the leadership of the Minister of Community Services and many of her colleagues, we are embarking on is an affordable housing program across this province. One aspect would be that we discovered that we have a tremendous amount of valuable land in this province that could be used to provide affordable housing - some of it can be done by government, some of it can be done by the private sector. If we can reach an arrangement with someone in the private sector to provide affordable housing in the community to keep rents down so that Nova Scotians can actually afford to live in those places, us donating that land would be a contribution.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, giving more of our money away to big business is also a contribution, apparently. Far from being independent of Cabinet, as the Liberals promised, the bill that is before the House clearly shows that the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism can change any decisions of the new, appointed board of the new slush fund. That means changing the recommendations when they want to give more of our money away, and it means changing the recommendations (Interruptions)</p>

As the Premier told The Chronicle Herald on September 26th, "We've made it clear that there would be no grants from a Liberal government."

          <p>HON. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, he asks a very significant question. It is not only in palliative care but as I've discovered in the last number of months, as Minister of Health and Wellness, we can sometimes put forward a provincial plan and it will get divided up nine different ways across the province. That's why I'm absolutely pleased to say we will have one provincial palliative care program and that quality and standard will be right across Nova Scotia.</p>

In 2005, in an effort to address over $14 billion in annual health care and social costs associated with alcohol abuse, Health Canada and the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse commissioned a panel to discuss a national alcohol strategy, and incidentally one of the members of that panel was our own Dr. Robert Strang, the chief medical officer for the province.</p>

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, in reference to the u-vint operations that are just now becoming legalized in the province, our government has been looking very much at the benefit to economies and to business growth in different parts of the province and we've already seen an increase in employment and in spending for renovations and expansion of existing businesses. Overall the advancement of this industry is a good one and I think that the rationale and the cost associated with it are reasonable.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, yesterday when asked why the Liberal Government wasn't going to allow alcohol to be sold in corner stores, the Acting Minister of Finance and Treasury Board said it was because of a letter sent by the Nova Scotia president of MADD Canada. But in its mission statement last revised in 2013, MADD Canada formally endorses the National Alcohol Strategy and it specifically highlights three key recommendations including ensuring u-vint licensing is, ". . . contingent upon matching the socially referenced price for beverage alcohol in that jurisdiction." I'll table the MADD Canada mission statement and policy document.</p>

It's a P to 9 model that has demonstrated great social and academic outcomes. Despite the nearly universal satisfaction with the school, the boundary review committee voted earlier this month to send Grades 7, 8 and 9 students to another community.

This formula has been working very well. It has obviously been challenged on a few occasions when we have a major build of a regional hospital. I think that formula will work for us this time around as we look at the future of the QEII.

          <from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from>
          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Natural Resources. The mining fee increase is adding approximately $75 million to $85 million to the government coffers. This is a small amount for government but devastating to the mining and prospecting industries. Miners and prospectors go through years and years of losses before they may have a claim that turns a profit. My question to the minster is, when the minister came into office and saw the changes that the NDP made on their way out the door, did the minister consult the industry for feedback or did he accept it as the status quo?</p>

          <p>HON. ZACH CHURCHILL : As the Minister of Natural Resources I've been in continual consultation with stakeholders in the mining sector along with any other sector that my department is involved in. Specifically with this issue, Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia was the last jurisdiction in the country to move off a paper-based application and licensing system. That previous system was causing major frustrations for the industry because the licensing process was being clogged up and it was costing prospectors additional funds to travel to this city to physically hand deliver their application to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. I am proud to say that this government supports the initiative to modernize that application of licensing process and I will add that we've done that while ensuring that our fees and the cost of being a prospector in the Province of Nova Scotia are at the national average.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, the Ivany report says from 2001 to 2011, Nova Scotia's mining and quarry industry shrank from a value of $285 million to $247 million, while the industry grew dramatically in almost every other province. Nova Scotia lost some 800 jobs in this sector over the five years prior to 2012 - and I will table that document. The fee increases will continue to hurt our mining and prospecting industries, so will the minister commit to abandon his attack on the mining industry and take note what the Ivany report says, that the mining industry "is essential if we are to build a stronger trade economy for the province as a whole?"</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, as the member knows the Ivany commission report is a document that this government takes very seriously and that report is helping us guide our directions in terms of what we do as a government. That is why we're doing business differently when it comes to the mining sector in this province. We moved from a paper system to one that's online - that's more responsive to the needs of that industry, and that makes it more efficient to do business here in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, the DNR released a document which the minister has quoted and I will table - DNR Stake Fees Analysis - and this document points to parity among provinces over a 10-year period, but the document includes not only the licence and the annual renewal fees, but also the annual required exploration work. Adding that to the annual required exploration expenses throws off this whole comparison. If we remove this added fee, the new fees are, on average, 53 per cent higher than in New Brunswick and a whopping 621 per cent higher than in Newfoundland and Labrador, where the claims are renewed every five years.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, the fee increase which the member is referring to is specific to the additional services that our government is now providing to the mining sector, services that have been needed for a generation. If you look at the administrative fees in their entirety, not specifically just this fee, our cost of doing business for the prospectors in the mining industry in this province is on par with the rest of the country and is competitive with our neighbours.</p>

The minister has just given approval for what he has called a pilot project involving radioactive fracking waste water from holding ponds at AIS - which is Atlantic Industrial Services in Debert - to be used in the production of cement in Lafarge's kiln in Brookfield. At a public meeting in Truro last week, residents expressed concern over the independence of the scientific evidence reviewed by the minister and his department.</p>

          <p>MR. DELOREY : Mr. Speaker, a couple of things. Yes, there is a process to use this water, which has been twice-treated. It has been carbon filtered to remove any radioactive materials from the waste water, as well as going through reverse osmosis. These test results, compared to the current freshwater going into the kiln, actually provide fewer items of concern. For example, the heavy metals, the items, parameters, that are assessed in these test results are actually less in the twice-treated water that has been approved through this pilot process. All indications from the science, the support, and the background that we have, as well as the notice that when the water goes through the kiln at 700 degrees all organic materials get combusted and any inorganic materials will fall to the clinker, as opposed to going out through the smokestacks. It will be the clinker residual that is tested and assessed before any final approval is given. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Public Service Commission. Prior to his election, the minister was asked about Liberal priorities in an August 8th CBC news television interview. When asked how the Liberals would fix the economic problems Nova Scotia is facing, he responded by saying, "We need more revenues for the province, and this will allow us to lower taxes and lower fees across the board." However, now that the minister has been elected, he seems to be singing from a different song sheet. Could the minister please explain to the House how asking Nova Scotians to foot the bill for 550 new civil servants moves us anywhere toward a place where we will possibly be able to lower taxes and fees across the board?</p>

Sadly, despite all of the advice, I still don't see how the minister thinks that 10,402 Public Service employees, minus 9,958 which they had last year, the difference is 550. You can try to spin that however you want but it's not fair to Nova Scotians. The truth of the matter is, you added 950 public servants.

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : I hope that the minister is transparent, is up front with the workers. As I said before in the House, these are some of the lowest paid workers in Capital Health and it is important that if the government is to continue on with their amalgamation of the district health authorities that they go after what their intentions were and that's the VPs and the CEOs of the district health authorities. I'd like to ask one more time to the minister to make it very clear that - I know he said there is no change in his statements that he made to that group in December and there is no current appetite for outsourcing the cafeteria and laundry service but . . .</p>

I can assure the member, and importantly, the workers at Capital Health who do housekeeping, laundry, and food service, that their current status will remain their future status.

          <from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from>
          <p>MR. JOHN LOHR : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. There are many indications that due to global warming, sea levels are rising. Nova Scotia has thousands of kilometres of dykes and these dykes are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture. Will the minister tell this House if the repaired maintenance of our dykes is a priority for his department?</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, yes, it most definitely is a priority for our department. It's not only just the farmland that is protected, but there are many towns and areas that have substantial assets at risk if these dykes are not maintained properly.</p>

          <p>MR. LOHR : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister for that answer and I would agree with him, that it is not only farmland, but thousands of Nova Scotian homes and communities that are protected. Many of these dykes are currently less than 50 centimetres above a very high tide and I would say this is inadequate. If ever there was a storm surge coinciding with a high tide, there would be considerable damage to many coastal communities. Will the minister inform this House of his department's activities to improve the quality of these dykes?</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : There has been an evaluation of all the dykes in the province and they are indeed going on a priority basis to raise the ones that need to be raised the most. There are some issues around some of the towns and areas where they're responsible for it. I'm not sure that they are raising the dykes as quickly as they should, but I can guarantee you my staff is working very diligently on this and will continue to work on it to ensure these viable assets are protected.</p>
