          <p>MR. SPEAKER : Thank you. I will take that under advisement, but I'd also remind the honourable member that the administrative duties of individual members of this House are not the responsibility of the government and constituency office. That was a part of the question that was asked to the minister, and that's the point that I was trying to make there, that it doesn't fall under the administrative responsibility of government. It falls under the constituency offices, not part of government. Thank you.</p>

          <p>HON. GRAHAM STEELE : Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of Bill No. 17, the Financial Measures (2012) Act. On April 3, 2012, I introduced Budget 2012 and Bill No. 17 is, in essence, a part of that budget. As members will know, a Financial Measures Bill is introduced every year to implement any legislative changes made necessary by the government's financial plan. That is the principle of the bill but there are three distinct pieces to the bill. The first piece of this year's Financial Measures (2012) Bill concerns a reduction in the HST.</p>

It is my pleasure to rise and debate on the Financial Measures (2012) Bill this afternoon, both as the member for Cumberland South and as the Finance Critic and Leader for my Party. This is indeed a unique Financial Measures (2012) Bill - the previous speaker talked about how light it was - but it certainly did contain something unique, which is that it had a magic asterisk in it this year for all Nova Scotians. It contains yet another new pre-election HST promise from the same bunch that gave us the last pre-election HST promise.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : I was making the point that Nova Scotia has the highest taxes in all of Canada in way too many categories. I know that the Minister of Finance refuses to acknowledge that. In fact, I've heard him say in this House that Nova Scotia is fifth in taxes paid in the country in dollar terms, but that ignores the fact that our incomes are lower than the national average in dollar terms. I think it is a great disservice to Nova Scotians to tell them that their tax burden is lighter than it is.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Some have suggested it should take a two-thirds vote of this House to undo the damage that government is about to do with this bill. You know what? If they're still there when the time comes to implement this and they want to break their promise again, it would still only take a majority vote to change the two-thirds law. The time has come to look around the country at what other taxpayer protections have been put in place in the face of a government that is so quick to break its promises after the election.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, we're pleased to support this bill. The one thing I will say is that, in light of many of the things that have come to light over recent months, it would certainly have been nice to see some additional amendments to the Probate Act, which would have given the trustees more teeth when it comes to addressing issues of timeliness and dealing with probates. Obviously, this bill in question deals with only the issue of $10,000 to $25,000, but a number of cases have come to light recently as a result of media reporting that show that it is a regular occurrence for probates of larger values to get delayed without the consent of the heirs and without timely notification of the heirs.</p>

We lost Senator Fred Dickson this past year and he was the gentleman who did the original negotiating on the Offshore Accord. The goal at that time, which remains today, was to ensure that our province is the principal beneficiary of those offshore royalty payments. At that time it was a statement of intent and it wanted to recognize Nova Scotia to ensure we get those revenues.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : The current legislation, the Mortgage Brokers' and Lenders' Registration Act, is outdated. It has not kept up with industry standards, best practices, or the various mortgage products available to consumers. Under existing legislation mortgage brokers in the province are not required to be initially licensed, nor are they required to follow any kind of professional or industry standards. In the past several years, six other provinces - Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia - have modernized legislation to enhance consumer protection and to facilitate regulation of the mortgage brokering industry, and that is what we are doing today.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I certainly don't dispute the value in providing mechanisms for people to protect land and to protect the use of lands, whether that is agricultural or forestry. It might even be beach access, I guess, to some extent. There's probably any range of possibilities, or at least so it appears in this bill.</p>

          <p>MR. HOWARD EPSTEIN : Mr. Speaker, what an interesting and surprising afternoon it has been. I don't know if I can remember when we saw so many government bills go through so quickly in such a short time. I'm not sure if this is because the Opposition has decided that they want to set records and they thought they've found themselves in a race or whether, surprisingly, they have suddenly found themselves in agreement with the government's agenda (Interruptions)</p>

I just really want to thank the member opposite for an excellent explanation of this bill because we've been asking for a week, what does it really do? All we've gotten from the minister and the department is, it's a clarification. Yet here we have a fulsome, thoughtful explanation of a bill.(Applause)</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure for me to say a few words on Bill No. 32, which is before us this evening, this being another amendment to the Securities Act. Although the minister mentioned the fact that it was not possible to create a single Securities Commission nationally, I think many provinces were in favour of it. I believe there were just one or two that were not. It's sort of unfortunate because Nova Scotia is a small jurisdiction and some are even smaller. I think it is something that would be a saving all the way across the board, to have one, if we are going to harmonize all of our laws.</p>

Of course, as we move towards harmonization of any piece of information across Canada, I think is a good thing, especially when it comes to securities, but ultimately we're looking forward to, of course, the next steps in the legislative process which is to send it off to the Law Amendments Committee, listening to maybe people with some questions about it or concerns, but it looks like the minister has done his homework on this one.</p>
