          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House there was some misinformation given on the province's funding commitment to the invaluable Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention - or EIBI - program. The misleading and inaccurate information provided by the member for Kings West has caused undue concerns among families. It is only right that the member for Kings West correct his mistaken comments and apologize to these members.</p>

          <p>HON.

It's not a matter of debate whether - when it happened or whatever the issue is. He has not really responded to the fullness of this statement, so he's clearly within his rights to do this.

          <from>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT</from>
          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : I just want to go to a couple of statements or points in this. I'm not going to get in the middle of that debate, but ultimately, when I look at the statement by the minister, when he says that the EIBI program is available to all eligible children, it doesn't mean that all eligible children can access it. Even though there are many times that they talk about the lottery system versus the system that they have today, there is still a wait-list for this, and people are waiting far too long to get services for their children. Many of them, even though they are identified at an early age, sometimes have to wait a year or more in order to get it. If you're identified at three, you might not get any service until at least four before going off to school.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, today we heard from family members of the veterans in the Northumberland Veterans Unit in Pictou about the frozen food that has been served to our elderly veterans there. Government knows about this issue. It is where the NDP's misguided attempts to get "back to balance" have hit the homes and tables of our veterans. In cutting $5 million over two years from the health authority in Pictou County, our veterans are eating standardized food.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, while this government is getting back to balance on the veterans in this province, Veterans Affairs has increased their budget to that district health authority. It's not good enough for this government to send down protocols. This government needs to stand up and demand that the money that this district health authority is receiving from Veterans Affairs is used to feed those veterans.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, for the past few months the Premier has been insisting that his government has implemented all of the recommendations of the MacKay anti-bullying task force. That is clearly not the case because as recently as today they continue to find new recommendations to implement.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, with all respect to the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, I did not say what he alleges I said. In fact, what I said was that we accepted the recommendations. They were the basis for the action plan for the government. The government has set out a very clearly-articulated action plan that has included the implementation, through legislation, of a certain number of those recommendations, implementation by preparation through the departments in order to facilitate other recommendations and now what they will see is this is yet another part of the overall implementation of those recommendations, which I understand was well received by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party and I think will be well received by the public.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I suppose when the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party says you have to listen very carefully to the fine print, that is a bit of a mixed metaphor although I get what he's trying to say. It is simply the case that there are many people out there - I have the benefit of getting the opinion of many people, regularly, often turning up in the newspaper. There are those people out there who say that we ought to slow down, that we are overreacting to one case and that we should wait for cooler heads to prevail. Then there are those who say that we should speed up and we should immediately act on all of these things.</p>

In Opposition we have put forward bills and ideas on cyberbullying for over a year. The MacKay task force is 18 months old, and some of its recommendations apparently remain under consideration and no more than that.</p>

Regardless of the federal issues that are at play, the Premier knows that there was a significant shortfall that happened within the Public Prosecution Service of Nova Scotia. There is no doubt of that. The victims are now being asked by the Premier to wait a little bit longer, wait for a review being done internally by the same players who would have been involved throughout this to see what went wrong. Something that the NDP, when they sat on this side of the House, would have clearly said was unacceptable for victims, but today in government, apparently, wait a little bit longer.</p>

What Nova Scotians want is a Premier who doesn't spend their money on TV ads taking credit for it. What they want is a real plan to turn the economy around, which starts with our suggestions of lowering their taxes and freezing their power rates and creating real jobs - and perhaps then 18,000 of them wouldn't have moved away last year, according to Statistics Canada.</p>

The recommendations contained in the report of the Nova Scotia Task Force on Bullying and Cyberbullying speaks directly to the tools which are being delivered to young people by the Cyber Internet Safety Society. In fact, they are currently delivering this to students across the province and by the end of June will have visited 40-plus schools, reaching 25,000 students, with more and more schools wanting them to visit and to give their presentation.

It is the terms of reference which actually dictate the manner in which the matter will be investigated. That's why we think it is very important that we get a trusted person, or people, to ensure that the terms of reference are adequate to ensure an examination of all the issues. The simple fact of the matter is this: we are the only government that actually met with the VOICES group, we are the only government that actually met with the alleged victims, we are the only government that has proceeded to listen to the complainants with respect to these issues, and we are the ones who are acting on it.</p>

So my final question to the Premier is, rather than complicate and drag out the process even more, will the Premier commit to a full public inquiry for the former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children?</p>

We already have a program that does this and by the end of June of this year, they will have visited over 40 schools in our province and exposed this program to 25,000 students.

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. The existence of Laing House, the Halifax non-profit drop-in centre for youth with mental illness, is being threatened by the NDP's crippling FCA labour legislation. The executive director, Maureen Fraser-McLaughlin, is very concerned about the bottom line and the possible impact FCA legislation will have on an organization that also relies on volunteers, and so are we. Not only is this legislation making Nova Scotia's economic environment unfriendly for businesses, it's also seriously affecting the non-profit sector.</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, we can see first-hand that FCA is negatively affecting small business and volunteer organizations, like Laing House, as we believed it would all along. We stood on principle that this was a bad idea. The Liberals, interestingly, said they were against it but were prepared to compromise with the NDP. There's a time to compromise but this was not it.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, in 2011 the NDP passed changes to the Land Registration Act which were supposed to clarify land titles in the province. However, it has come to our attention that there are still gaps being experienced by Nova Scotians. When faced with this feud over property lines, Nova Scotians are finding that their only recourse is through expensive court battles that can take years and cost thousands of dollars and in the end, a satisfactory outcome may or may not happen for both parties. Will the Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations admit there are serious issues with the present system?</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : I'm happy to stand for a moment to speak on this bill. This is something similar to what our caucus here put forward back a while ago with regard to - at that point it was Segways and allowing them to drive and we've seen a bit of that here in the province, certainly in Windsor. I saw one the other day actually going up the sidewalk. I haven't tried one yet, but they look like they may be interesting. I look forward to trying one at some point and I'm sure I'll get the opportunity.</p>

This legislation will reimburse more than 100 Nova Scotian women whose husbands died as a result of workplace accidents, and who were denied benefits because they had remarried before April 17, 1985. This is when the equal rights section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into effect, ensuring women could no longer be discriminated against based on their marital status. Every woman whose husband is killed on the job should be treated fairly and compensated properly. In the past, this didn't happen. This wasn't acceptable to our government and we're doing something about it and we're doing the right thing today, Madam Speaker.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : I'm pleased today to make some comments on this important piece of legislation, Bill No. 55, the Protection of Animal Welfare and Security Act. I think there are a couple of things that do need to be pointed out and talked about and deliberated about in this House, in regard to this piece of legislation. Just a few years ago a bill came before the Nova Scotia Legislature, the Animal Protection Act, and it was a long time in the making. There were a lot of interventions, a lot of submissions and draft comments, and at that time we looked at legislation. I know my colleague, the member for Halifax Clayton Park did quite a study on what was happening in other jurisdictions, especially B.C., in Surrey, jurisdictions in the U.S., on how we could strengthen the Animal Protection Act so that the welfare of our pets could be safeguarded to a much greater degree. That Act separated agricultural animals and companions, or our pets.</p>

It is my pleasure to stand and speak to this bill, Bill No. 55, the Protection of Animal Welfare and Security Act, for a few moments. It was only last week that I had the opportunity and the pleasure to introduce a petition in this House signed by over 4,300 people, where the operative line was to strengthen the laws for animal protection, to provide better work for the organizations that do enforce - better enforcement - so that it doesn't happen that what we get to see on a daily basis in the paper, in the news, is where we see animals being abused in our province.</p>

I would like to personally thank the Minister of Agriculture for presenting this bill, which I think is very important in Nova Scotia. As a dog owner myself - I have three, actually, and many of my friends have dogs - we felt, when this issue first came up, it was an important one for the province to take a look at and to actually move forward on. It still boggles my mind when I hear stories of abuse towards anybody - people, animals - and it seems strange that we have to actually put these things into writing to look after and protect innocent creatures, but in fact we do. So it's nice to be able to see that in this bill they are speaking about anxiety, and these kinds of things which are more subtle but are so, so important as definitions of distress.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : This is a bill that I think is really important and it follows some outcry from the public about animal welfare. I know the minister started by saying one of the first bills brought forward was the new bill on animal protection which was really needed, absolutely needed. I remember at the time when we were involved in that and discussing what the points were. It had two points really, one part was very much the farm animals and that aspect which, as a city member, I certainly care about the welfare of animals on farms, but I was less concerned about that because I heard more from people about pets. I thought that the bill was a little bit shy on the pet side and more heavily weighted towards farm animals, work animals, and so on.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : I'm pleased to rise today on Bill No. 57 which is this Act for international schools, called the Language Schools Act. This Act is for schools that are teaching English here in Nova Scotia. I was interested to see that there are 12 schools right now with 1,500 students, here in our province. One question that I would have for the minister is, at the end of the press release that was on the Web site - somebody told me earlier to look at the Animal Act on the Web site - but on the Web site it does say that this would relate to programs over six months. Maybe in his closing comments the minister might refer to which programs are covered because I do know a lot of programs exist in our province, which are summer programs and students come here from various countries to spend, perhaps six weeks to two months studying English and having the experience of being in an English-speaking environment, and so on.</p>

I would like to know if there will be standards set for the shorter programs that also exist, and I know there are study and learning tours that go on in the province as well, where students are toured around Nova Scotia and learning English at the same time.

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to very briefly speak to Bill No. 57, the Language Schools Act. As the member for Halifax Clayton Park has referenced, there are 12 language schools in Nova Scotia with about 1,500 students. I know that in particular McKenzie College Language Academy in Sydney and the International Centre for English Academic Preparation at CBU are both pleased with this legislation coming forward.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, thanks to the Deputy Premier and to the House for that warm welcome. I want to spend a few minutes, I'd be remiss if I didn't speak on this bill put forth by the government side and I think the Deputy Premier, certainly all the members of the House but those who have seen some of the impact that the language schools have had in Cape Breton. With the Cape Breton economy, I think it's important just to talk about some of those things.</p>

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, it's interesting in a debate around international schools and it invariably goes to English as a Second Language, and you had three Cape Bretoners following each other. I'm reminded of the story - and the member for Glace Bay may remember his father telling him stories about this gentleman. But Angus "Blue" MacDonald was a very famous councillor from the Town of Glace Bay, and he had a vocabulary unto his own. But he had very heavy Cape Breton slang, if you will, which I think we're all very proud of.</p>

          <p>MR. GARY RAMEY : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I noticed in that resolution, which I read, and found the grammatical structure a little obtuse, but anyway, the word in there is "condemn." You know, I know my colleague from Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, he is sort of the resident expert on condemnation, I think, so I might have to ask him why. I don't think we should be condemned, I don't think I should be, or my colleagues. I have to defend them. Of course the premise is completely incorrect, so I'll offer up something here, and we'll see where we're going with this. And I'd like to focus it around, actually, three areas, if I could. You know, support we've put out there for families; support for students; and support for future jobs.</p>
