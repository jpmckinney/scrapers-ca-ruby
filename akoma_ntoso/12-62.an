          <p>MR. SPEAKER : While I have received more than two hours' notice of the matter required under Rule 43(2), under Rule 43(4) I'm required to decide whether the matter is proper to be discussed. I have considered the factors set out in Rule 43(4A), this is a matter of grave concern to Nova Scotians and which concerns the administrative responsibilities of the government and could come within the scope of ministerial action. It is not on the order paper for discussion and I have no indication that it is likely to be debated within a reasonable time by other means, so I will read the motion and ask whether the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party caucus has the leave of the House for the debate to take place.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : My question is for the Premier. Will the Premier make certain that the Bowater lands are not taken from Nova Scotians and will he expropriate the lands for the public good of the Province of Nova Scotia?</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'm a little bit amused by the question mainly because the Leader of the Opposition was so critical of the purchase of the last piece of Bowater's lands. I believe members of his caucus referred to it as dirt and various other admonishments with respect to the purchase of that part, despite the fact that much of what was purchased in the last round with Bowater was actually in the Leader of the Opposition's riding. What he should know is that these matters are under full consideration and when a decision is made, we'll make sure he is one of the first people to know.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, our caucus was never opposed to buying the land. What we were opposed to was what the Premier was prepared to pay but Nova Scotians are becoming used, quite frankly, to the Premier opening the chequebook and writing a large cheque and allowing someone else to fill it in.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, what is not in question is that the motion that was set in place by this government was to expropriate land from a small, privately-owned Nova Scotia business to give to a multinational corporation. What not is in question is that this Premier is unwilling to stand up to Resolute to protect that land for the use of Nova Scotians. He needs to treat the multinationals the same way that he is treating Nova Scotia small businesses, with the same disrespect.</p>

It is, of course, initiated by someone who decides they want to do exploration in the province. (Interruption) And I might point out the to the Leader of the Opposition, if he will be quiet long enough for me to answer his question, I might point out to him that this is, in fact, the same process that was underway for decades, including the last time. . .

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, in fact, this government has lived up to exactly the letter of this bill because what it was intended to do was to bring transparency, which you have, you have full transparency on this side of the government. Just to give you an example, the largest of these is a $300 million commercial loan to the Irving Shipbuilding yard, which can only be forgiven if they reach job targets that would provide more than $2 billion in tax revenue to the province, which can go to provide services to exactly the people who the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is referring to.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as you would know, and perhaps just due to the member's inexperience he wouldn't know - in any kind of an agreement, a commercial agreement or otherwise, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Since everything is not agreed, there is no agreement.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, if the Premier wants to talk about inexperience, he might want to talk to members of his own Cabinet and caucus, given the fact that we've had some of them say that there is a deal and use the "is a deal" tense. Some of them say there's a deal coming, some of them say there's a deal agreed to. Last year it was good enough for the Premier to bring the proposed Resolute deal to the House when he thought he was going to save all of those jobs, but now this new deal to buy the lands from Resolute or maybe buy the lands or maybe there is a deal, maybe there isn't, seems to be shrouded in secrecy.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things about this. One is that the last time we purchased land from Resolute, the Liberal caucus was very critical of it even though we paid below market value for some of the highest-value land in the province. That's the first thing. The second thing is that because of their inexperience, or because of their misunderstanding of how these things work, they would prefer that we go to an expropriation process, which is what was apparently proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, but doesn't seem to understand that the Bowater assets are far more than just the lands that are there, and that there are other pieces associated with this and other considerations.</p>

The positions of the small business advocate and consumer advocate are, when they submitted their final submissions, was that Nova Scotia Power should be disallowed costs on fuel derating at Lingan. The consumer advocate talked about not passing onto ratepayers costs associated with the all-out war by Nova Scotia Power and its auditors. Yet the government in their submission doesn't mention these at all. In fact, it says that the settlement agreement warrants consideration and seems reasonable.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, in fact, we do agree with them and we have said so. The simple fact of the matter is that when they reach agreements they do so broadly and they are designed to make sure that the fairest, lowest rates are available to ratepayers, which is why we brought in the legislation that we brought in to disallow many of the expenses that were formally allowed to be considered. It is why we don't consider the kinds of things that the Liberal Party would do and the Opposition would do. For example, deregulation of our system which would lead to increases - severe, unexpected increases like we see in Alberta and in Ontario where taxpayers have to underwrite the cost of the utility just to keep the prices reasonable. What they would do is cause the rapid increase to consumers of electricity rates by 30 - 50 per cent.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, recent news that six long-serving members of the mental health and addiction services team in the Cape Breton District Health Authority have been relieved of their duties has many concerned. The counsellor attendants with a combined 95 years of valuable experience treated and supported patients with substance abuse issues, they were replaced by others.</p>

          <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, no question, the issue of mental health and addiction services here in Nova Scotia is an important one. That's why as a government, when we took over in 2009, we did consultation throughout the province to try to figure out some of the services and improvements that we needed to make within the health care system here in Nova Scotia, especially for mental health and addiction.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, in a letter to the editor in the Cape Breton Post, Regina Gillis writes: "The disease of addiction does not respond to bandages or pills. The whole person must be healed." I'll table that. The concerns being raised by Regina Gillis and others are valid. Counsellor attendants use their years of experience to fight the deadly disease of addiction. That is a tool we cannot afford to simply toss away.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, it's extremely important that Nova Scotians gain access to the services they need, and that includes those individuals who are seeking support for addictions in Nova Scotia. I recognize the importance and the commitment and the work that many health care providers have provided, especially in addiction services. I have mentioned it before in a question earlier in this session: it's extremely hard when you do change the model of care; unfortunately, there are some people whose job descriptions may have to change. Those individuals who we rely on to provide those services may change, or the scope of practice for an individual may change.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, this is just the latest in a long line of NDP failures when it comes to substance-abuse patients in Cape Breton. We all know the Talbot House file was mishandled by the NDP's incompetent Minister of Community Services. People suffering from addictions in Cape Breton cannot afford to see this kind of injustice repeated. Will the minister commit today to reverse the NDP's misguided approach to addiction services in Cape Breton and actually deal with the crisis at hand?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is completely wrong. I'm very proud of the decisions that my government, our government, has made over the last three years when it comes to health care, and especially addiction services. We rely on district health authorities like the Cape Breton District Health Authority to recognize the services and the changes needed to meet the needs of the patients that they serve. We work with the district health authority in Cape Breton to ensure that addiction services could be improved upon, and I'm glad to work with district health authorities across this province - unlike what the former government would like to do, and that's create one super board that would have all those decisions being made out of Halifax. I want to work with the district health authority in Cape Breton to ensure that Cape Bretoners have access to the health care they need, and I'm proud of the decisions we've made here.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, recent media reports have many people shaking their heads. While government will pay for the drugs necessary to keep palliative care patients at home, they do not pay for the nutritional therapy replacement - in other words, their food. While the nutritional therapy is available in hospital, it's not covered for those who have chosen to take their loved ones home to die. Could the minister please explain how this makes any sense?</p>

          <from>HON. DAVID WILSON</from>
          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, what makes sense is that Nova Scotians have a government that recognizes the importance of end-of-life or palliative care. For far too often and for many, many years, government has not put a priority on end-of-life or palliative care. As the member opposite just mentioned, Nova Scotians now receive support from this government because of changes in end-of-life and palliative care.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : As the minister well knows, many families are handcuffed. They have no choice, their loved one has to go to hospital because they can't afford to keep them at home and afford the nutrition.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : We recognize the financial burden that was placed on patients, their families and their loved ones, Mr. Speaker, by previous governments' decisions and that was not to fund drugs for end-of-life care or palliative care unless they were in a hospital in a few district health authorities. We recognized that that wasn't right. That's why we took the steps to lessen the financial burdens on families in Nova Scotia, to pay for those medications if they choose to stay at home for the end of their life. This year alone with the announcement that we will cover end-of-life, palliative care drug costs for any Nova Scotian, no matter where they live, was an investment of $240,000. Next year we predict, or forecast, that that could be up to about $800,000, an investment that former governments didn't make, an investment that this government did make.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Well, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to help the minister to save more money because here are the financial facts: $1,000 a day, roughly, for a hospital bed, which includes food for a palliative care patient, versus $33 per day to feed a palliative care patient at home. When you contrast $1,000 per day with $33 per day, it's abundantly clear. The health care system wins, the taxpayer wins, and most importantly the patient wins when a nutritional-therapy replacement is funded.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : As I said earlier in my previous answer, this is a government that recognizes the importance of trying to improve services within health care and that includes end-of-life and palliative care. Often, it's a subject that not a lot of us want to talk about or deal with but we all recognize that eventually we have to deal with palliative care or end-of-life care. That's why we are going to continue to work within the health care system. That's why we are going to continue to work within reality and the financial reality of the province.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, we welcomed a task force on rural economic development. It is disappointing, however, that it took this government three and a half years to figure out that one was necessary. The government has denied the troubles facing rural Nova Scotia. We've seen a population drop by 8,200 people and we've seen the number of full-time jobs drop by 4,400. Since taking office, the job market and the economy of rural Nova Scotia have worsened.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the Premier and the Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Minister have continually touted jobsHere as the plan to save rural Nova Scotia. Three years ago the unemployment rate in rural Nova Scotia was 10.2 per cent - certainly a crisis level. Today the unemployment rate is even worse at 11.8 per cent. In fact, the unemployment rate in rural Nova Scotia has never been below 10 per cent since this government took office. My question to the minister is, why did he fail to recognize and realize the struggles of rural Nova Scotia when the economic struggles of these regions have been clear since this government was elected?</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Thank you again, I appreciate that. I know few comments were accompanied by that moving of third reading but there are a couple of things that should be said on this bill. Number one, this bill is allowing the importation of wine between provinces. A few provinces in Canada have moved that and made it law, not too many. The federal government made a change in their legislation, which has paved the way for this to occur and now the provinces need to respond if they think it's a good move to relax our importation rules of wine and our province has seen fit to do so, which I think is a good idea.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Madam Speaker, I'm just going to take a moment once again here on third reading, as I did on second, to show support for this bill. As a matter of fact, as I said, I think in second reading, this mirrors a bill that I put before this House just a couple of weeks prior to this introduction of Bill No. 143. Having said that, it is certainly something that is good for our province, good for the industry, and we certainly want to continue to see this wine industry grow and become even more than it is today. This is all good for us in the province.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Madam Speaker, this is an important topic for consideration of the House and I think we first have to start at the beginning. We have to try to reflect on the position we were in when the Progressive Conservatives were last in power and how this project came about.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, it's always interesting to listen to the Premier. You know, Nova Scotians are going to get an opportunity for the Premier and myself and the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to debate our plans, but that election call - who knows when it will happen? What they are hoping for is that the Premier will finally wake up and stand up to Nova Scotia Power instead of being their cheerleader. That's what he does. (Interruptions)</p>

It's under your watch that the equity of that company has gone through the roof. It is under your watch that power rates have gone up 30 per cent. It is under your watch that shareholders are doing well. (Interruption) Mr. Speaker, I never thought I'd hear the day when I'd wish for the former Finance Minister to reappear. While we may not have always agreed, you can't say he didn't understand what was going on.</p>

We know that coal is a very big part of our energy source in Nova Scotia and it's going to be. We stand in this House and we talk and we make it sound like coal is going to end tomorrow, bang, it's gone.

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, we heard the Premier today, in response to our call for this emergency debate, in his remarks he mentioned that they were trying to put together a diversified portfolio of energy inputs. This would be a great idea if they are affordable. It would be a great idea if they reduce carbon emissions, but this government's energy policy does neither.</p>

          <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Well, I don't have a lot of time but one of the statements that I had made was that the energy policy of this government actually does nothing to reduce carbon emissions. We've actually seen carbon emissions increase since this government has come to power. One of the reasons they are increasing is because if we've moved toward things like wind energy and because wind energy is intermittent, it needs to be supplanted with inefficient burning of fossil fuels to make up for a lack of energy when the wind is not blowing. I really don't care if the members opposite don't believe this, I happen to know it's a fact. I've done my research and this information is going to come forward more and more as time goes on but the point is, this government, if they are trying to reduce carbon emissions, they are failing, and anybody who is concerned about the environment should be aware of that.</p>

          <p>MS. MICHELE RAYMOND: Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this resolution. I have to say that I'm less comfortable bandying about in speculative figures than some of the members opposite, but what I am able to say is that I am very, very pleased to hear that we are able to have such firm predictions as 2 per cent to 3 per cent increases - not because a 2 per cent or 3 per cent increase every year in residential rates is a good thing, but because it is a predictable thing. If there's nothing else that we have learned, risk costs.</p>
