          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise in my place this afternoon to speak to the important topic of school board budget deliberations. Nova Scotians expect school boards to make decisions that put children and learning first. This means doing everything they can to protect important resources that benefit students.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in my place to respond to the ministerial statement. We did get a copy of it 10 minutes prior to the House sitting. However, we've had a chance to review it, and certainly expected that the minister would be taking this step based on comments and probably some threats, if you might call them that. So let's look at the statement.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I rise to respond not only as the Leader of the Progressive Conservative caucus but also as the MLA for Cumberland South, one of the constituencies in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board and as a MLA and recipient of many emails and letters in the last few days as the issue around librarians and other cuts has come forward.</p>

          <from>MR. SPEAKER</from>
          <p>MR. SPEAKER : Before I move on to Government Notices of Motion, I've reviewed the petition submitted by the honourable member for Truro-Bible Hill. Unfortunately, all the petitions must bear original signatures - photocopies of petitions and printouts of Internet petitions are not acceptable. It's been ruled on many times in this House of Assembly, so I rule this petition out of order.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier stood in this House, in front of the television cameras, calling the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board's decision to lay off librarians "a political game." We saw there are many Nova Scotians who believed yesterday that the Premier was the one playing the political games. After the ministerial statement by the Minister of Education, she seemed to have joined into those political games that this government seems to be playing with our students and education.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in the last budget session the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board cut 20 per cent from the administrative costs of its board. Many of the people left on that board are there to deliver programs that are demanded by provincial governments. All at the same time, though, in the minister's department, you have a new position created for an associate deputy minister; we have an increase in administrative costs, almost every budget line is going up in her department, but yet school boards are being asked to deliver more with less. Can the Premier tell Nova Scotians why his Minister of Education deserves more, but our students deserve less?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, he knows that's not true. He knows that's exactly the same person, in the same position, with a different title - no different employee whatsoever. The fact of the matter is, we are streamlining the budget of this province, we're taking out FTEs where we are capable of doing that without destroying the service. We are doing it in a common-sense, reasonable way in order to make sure that the money that the taxpayers of Nova Scotia entrust us with are spent in the most effective and efficient way.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I would suggest the Premier read the budget that was delivered here last week because there's no question there are administrative costs going up in the Department of Education. We've created a new position, it may be the same person from the department filling it, but he's getting paid more money. There are more FTEs being budgeted in the Department of Education, all at the same time this Premier is bullying school boards across this province and telling them to do more with less. I want the Premier to stand up and tell Nova Scotians how they are going to deliver their education without the proper funding.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think the Leader of the Opposition ought to read the budget. The number of FTEs in the Department of Education went down, not up. The school boards in this province are receiving the highest level of funding per student in their history.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it may be the highest funding per student in our history, but a lot of that is being sucked right over to the Department of Education and not being delivered where it should be. The Premier talks about forcing school boards to deliver education to the students and at the desk, maybe he better start by telling the minister to stop pulling the money that should be going to school boards and hiding it in her department. Why doesn't the Premier finally show some leadership and stand up for students in this province and demand that we have a reduction in the Department of Education and deliver that money directly to the students in this province?</p>

          <from>HON. KAREN CASEY</from>
          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, libraries are a valuable resource within our public schools. They are the hubs of independent learning and research and for developing literacy skills and for fostering a love of reading. With this government's gutting of the public education system, boards are being forced to close their school libraries. Last year it was the South Shore Regional School Board that lost 80 per cent of the library technicians and this year it's Chignecto. Teachers report that librarians often organize author visits and after-school activities. My question to the minister is, does the minister - and to what extent does she - value library services?</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : As a direct result of this government's callous cuts many librarians and library technicians in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board may lose their jobs and they may lose the support of that valuable learning. Yesterday, during Question Period the Premier said that this is nothing but a political game being played by the school board. Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. The school boards are not playing political games; the students are not interested in playing political games or being used in a political game, they are looking to this minister for support. So will the minister demonstrate that support that she has stated that she has for school libraries? Will she demonstrate that and provide targeted money to the school boards to save their libraries?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. The government likes to talk about its funding to education, but unfortunately they're putting it in all the wrong places. The Premier imposes restraint on the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board and other school boards, but it is a restraint that is not practised by the head office of his own Department of Education.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that's not what's happening. In fact, he would know that he is comparing apples and oranges. The numbers that he is using include positions that were vacant in the previous year - they were still funded FTEs. The overall numbers of FTEs in the province have gone down by seven and I tabled that information for your information last week.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My point is, who is playing games now? Facts and figures are being thrown around but here is a number that every Nova Scotian can understand and I quote from the government's own head count report, head count, not FTEs, how many people, how many heads at the Department of Education for the most recent year? It was 193 last year, it's 196 this year. That's plus three in head counts, something every Nova Scotian can understand. It is up not down and I will table the head count report for the Premier's own perusal.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, again, you want to talk about playing games, he's using a head count number, which of course - if you have two people sharing an FTE you get two people. He's using - trying to manipulate that data to tell people something that simply isn't true, which is that there are less FTEs in the Department of Education. In fact, the Department of Education is sharing in the burden of making sure we get back to balance.</p>

Nova Scotians have a right to know that this minister did her job to protect vulnerable children. The more the minister tries to deflect, the more it becomes clear she's not up to the job.

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Education keeps talking about student/teacher ratios in our province. However, her numbers are simply misleading. A more accurate description of what she is talking about would be the student-to-employee ratio, considering that the numbers include more than simply classroom teachers.</p>

          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, the ratio for teachers in our system to children is 12.9. If you take out administrators - I will take the administrators out of that number - the ratio is 14.7. The real test is how many children are in the class? We have the lowest class sizes in elementary, junior high, and in high school than we have had in a generation.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, because of the NDP cuts to education, class sizes are increasing and teachers are being forced to spend less time teaching. The minister knows this, this is why she increased the minimum class size. Larger class sizes mean that there are more students for every teacher in the classroom, contrary to what this minister and this government keep saying. With more students, the classroom teacher has less time to deliver the quality of education we expect from our schools.</p>

As part of the review process by the school board, parents, educators, and students wrote to the Minister of Education asking for her intervention in the process.

This government did not want to see children wait until Grade 1 and then, almost through a lottery system, one or two children getting Reading Recovery. We wanted them to get in to make sure our children are supported early in Primary and carried through as they need support when they need it, not wait for one or two spots in a Reading Recovery program that was expensive.

          <p>MS.

These teachers are highly skilled at early literacy intervention and they're a great resource in our public education system. Hundreds of students in the Reading Recovery program have been successful and are confident young readers. For a nominal licensing fee of approximately $3,000 per board, hundreds of our current students could still be benefiting from Reading Recovery.</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, the honourable member made a comment "may work for them" and that is just the problem with Reading Recovery. Unfortunately, our data state that by the time the children made it to Grade 3, the significant gains they had made, they had lost; it was not sticking. We also know with Reading Recovery, not every student is recorded. If they are excused from the Reading Recovery program without succeeding, their name drops off the data. We make sure that our students in Primary and Grade 1 and now in Grade 2 are going to have the supports they need. Reading Recovery teachers are the ones who are doing early literacy because they have training in early literacy and they are trained experts, and they're now meeting the needs of more of our students in our system.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, imagine a typical Nova Scotia classroom; the class includes a high-needs autistic child and two children with ADHD, not an uncommon experience here in this province. Suddenly the teacher who used to have a full-time educational assistant only has a part-time one, the result of NDP budget cuts. So, as if the demands on the teacher weren't challenging enough, that teacher is now left to provide a quality education for all students, with fewer resources at his or her disposal. I'm wondering, how would the Minister of Education cope with this situation if she experienced those cutbacks in her classroom?</p>

The students with special needs have lost their valuable support system and they've lost their best opportunity to learn. The other children in the class will not receive the attention from the teacher that they need and deserve and the teachers' resources are stretched to the breaking point.

We are committed to keeping their tuition at or below the national average and we have certainly been able to keep that commitment. We are doing everything possible to make university education in this province, post-secondary education in a more general sense, affordable and accessible to Nova Scotians. We're committed to that and we'll stick to it. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, on March 5th, the Talbot House closure was abruptly announced by the Minister of Community Services. At that time, arrangements were made by the Minister of Community Services to transfer 14 individuals in varying stages of addiction treatment - treatment that falls under the mandate of the Minister of Health and Wellness. Given the Minister of Community Services displayed her sensitive and caring nature last week by saying virtually nothing about the availability of current programs and services to clients, I am wondering what role did the Minister of Health and Wellness play in ensuring that the ongoing treatment of clients who had been receiving treatment at Talbot House has been adequate?</p>

The board of directors made a decision to close Talbot House and we took care of the residents who were on-site; there were approximately five to six, and we found another location for them.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the minister can point fingers at the board all she wants, but the fact is she's responsible for treatment not only of the current residents, but also for those who are seeking residential treatment with options that are quickly dwindling. The option to provide residential treatment for individuals with addictions in this province is decreasing at a rapid pace - Recovery House in Antigonish, a 28-day recovery program, had its funding discontinued by this government; Talbot House closed; Compass Program - another 28-day intensive, structured residential treatment program - closed under this government's mandate. My question to the Minister of Health and Wellness, how will wait times for individuals with addictions who need intensive, structured treatment go down when the options available for this type of treatment in this province are disappearing?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, addiction services are very, very important services to have in place for people who need to go through withdrawal, often through a residential-based program, and then we can provide a variety of options to people including ongoing treatment and follow-up, and frequently these programs can be done on an outpatient or day-program basis.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the reality is that structured residential treatment is, for many, the best option. The government has dismantled addiction treatment options in this province without ever having released a mental health and addiction strategy. It's like the minister is hoping these individuals who do not respond well to community based programs will just go away. How will the minister ensure those requiring structured programming to deal with their addictions are able to get treatment in a timely manner?</p>

Yesterday we learned that on November 15th the Department of Community Services knew that an alleged pedophile was employed as a bus driver for the East Preston Day Care. The Department of Justice was the obvious source for this information. Will the minister tell us what exact date he became aware of the risk to preschoolers at the daycare?</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for that question. I just want to add to my colleague's position on this. The important fact here is that when there are allegations or alleged actions made in our communities, a report is made to the appropriate police agency and in this case it was done. I have all the respect for the police officers in this province, but a common thread that seems to be coming from the Third Party is that they lack confidence in the qualities and skills of our highly professional police officers. That's a bit disturbing.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, we would have confidence in this Minister of Justice if he could provide us a date. We have placed great emphasis on this matter here in Question Period because the allegations of past abuse by this individual are very disturbing. If they are true, we are concerned another young person could suffer the same experience.

LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I want to assure all Nova Scotians that I, as the Minister of Justice, take any actions that are aggressive or violent against a child, or abuse of any manner - I take that seriously. The Department of Justice acts promptly on all allegations and issues. As my colleague had mentioned, on the date that her office became aware, they took appropriate action by notifying the police and then allowing the process. She did that immediately as reported in the House, and I stand by my colleague's comments.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, another part of this whole process is that our judicial process is well respected, highly professional and does an excellent job. Public Prosecution is an independent body to look at all issues such as this that come forward and look for the substance with regard to allegations. Remember, we must respect allegations while at the same time assuring the rights and safety of all children. I take that job seriously and I act on those matters promptly and I have all the confidence in the steps that were taken to this date.</p>

It gives me an opportunity to outline that as Minister of Justice I take all matters that deal with violence seriously, and that over the last year - as I reported the last time this House sat - I have been meeting with colleagues throughout the justice system. In fact, I have recently met with the police - both the RCMP and the Halifax Regional Police - and I compliment them on the strategic steps that they are taking to do enforcement when violent incidents are occurring.

What is unfortunate is that when we called upon both him and the Premier to stand up to the federal government and tell them the Province of Nova Scotia will not have taxpayers' dollars going to build more jails to suit a federal policy of the Harper Government, they both fell silent. Neither the Premier nor the Minister of Justice stood up; yet in other provinces the Premier spoke up, the Ministers of Justice spoke up. Ontario, for example, calculated that if this bill is implemented, it could cost the Province of Ontario an extra $1 billion of taxpayers' funds to go build jails for Prime Minister Harper.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : I would support that school in Cole Harbour but do we have to build another one in order to do that because it didn't take the students out of the Memorial school when they had a problem with their ventilation system. That ventilation system, Madam Speaker, still sits there. The duct work is there, we can't get the vacuum system. That system severely handicaps what those students can do in their shop program. They had a school in South Colchester that had the same vacuum system, on a smaller scale, installed.</p>

This government who says, we care more about education than anybody else, ever. However, the previous government, who invested a significant amount of dollars in education, that doesn't matter.
