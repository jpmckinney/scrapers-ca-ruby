Today is Earth Day, an annual event celebrated world-wide, where events are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection. Two big areas where more work needs to be done in Nova Scotia relate to Boat Harbour and the emissions from the pulp mill that operates nearby.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I can only point out that testing is not a cleanup. In fact, there have been 40 years of evidence that Boat Harbour is a toxic mess, an embarrassment and an offence to the environment of Nova Scotia. The time for more studies, for more testing - as good as testing is - is not going to change the fact that all Nova Scotians know, particularly those that live in the area, that this is an environmental mess that deserves to be cleaned up.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to hear that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party brought up 2008. You want to talk about a political commitment, Mr. Speaker - there was no financial commitment made by that government, and quite frankly no plan to clean up Boat Harbour. As I just said to the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the information associated with Boat Harbour dates back to 1996. In order for us to move forward on a cleanup, we need to know - the Department of Environment needs to know, actually, what is in Boat Harbour. I'm sure that the members of Pictou would also be telling their Leader that there are other issues associated with Boat Harbour that are unrelated to the mill.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Well Mr. Speaker, I hate to say it, but we've just heard from the king of political promises, because that Premier signed his name on a document in the heat of an election campaign to the people of Pictou County that he would monitor emissions from the mill and that he would report them publicly. It's six months later, and we're all still waiting. Now he says he wants to clean up Boat Harbour. I sure hope that's true, so that this isn't just another political promise. We want to see action on Boat Harbour.</p>

In the first six months of being in power, we've embarked on trying to find out exactly what is in that harbour. How can we put a plan out to the people of this province until we know what has actually been dumped into that harbour? The Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is suggesting that the only challenge is around the mill. There are other issues associated with Boat Harbour.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Premier. In 2012, the provincial government entered into a memorandum of understanding with universities, which set out the funding for post-secondary institutions for a three-year period. This MOU mandated that university tuition would stay at or below the national average, not be increased by more than 3 per cent, and that a tuition policy review would take place before the end of the MOU.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the question. The Minister of Labour and Advanced Education is continuing to do great work on behalf of this government, working with post-secondary institutions, recognizing the valuable contribution they make not only in educating our young students, but as an immigration tool they use bringing 20,000 other young Canadian and foreign students into this province and also recognizing the economic driver they can be by ensuring that we do job creation through providing research into the marketplace.</p>

We are allowing more apprenticeship opportunities for NSCC graduates. We are working with small-business owners across this province to provide a graduate with opportunities, it's a job. We're working with employers to give jobs to graduates in this province. We not only have shown concern with our words, we've shown it with our actions.</p>

With many students in the province looking forward to starting university in the Fall, and returning to university in the Fall, they have yet to know what the tuition increases will be for next year. I want to ask the Premier, will he tell Nova Scotia students now how much his government will allow tuition to increase next year?</p>

We have said that very clearly and we are in negotiations with universities around an MOU to provide long-term stability, at the same time recognizing the valuable contribution that they make to this province on so many fronts. From an immigration strategy, from job creation, finally universities and university graduates have a government that is actually paying attention to them.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotia is one of three provinces in Canada that does not index its income tax brackets to inflation. When he was in Opposition, the Premier said very clearly that he believes bracket creep costs Nova Scotians millions of dollars a year in hidden tax increases.

          <p>MR.

They just go ahead and do it at the first opportunity. But whenever anybody suggests a way we can actually lower the tax burden on Nova Scotians, they are promised further study. When they want to raise it, it's instant; when someone wants to lower it, it requires further study.</p>

They're looking at the incidents of people who have left, rather than the incidents of people who have been retained, this is a retention rebate.

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Municipal Affairs. The recent budget contains funding for rural transit systems. There are many areas of Nova Scotia that are concerned about the process and guidelines regarding how these funds will be disbursed. The towns and cities around the province have very different demographics and very different needs. My question for the minister is, what are the guidelines and application process to access this money?</p>

          <p>HON. MARK FUREY : Mr. Speaker, the funding announced for transit in the budget captured three areas: Halifax Regional Municipality, those areas outside of HRM, as well as the Community Transportation Assistance Program, a total of $3.5 million that will go to both HRM and rural communities. Staff are in the process of finalizing the disbursement of those monies and I'm quite confident that my colleague on the opposite side of the House will be encouraged once that information and that process is released.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, the Liberal platform says, "A Liberal Government will implement a provincial transportation strategy by: Invest in public transit and community-based transit outside the capital region." I'll table that document. This document was drafted well before the election, which means that this promise was researched and documented well over six months ago. So my question to the minister is, with over six months to work on this project, what research has the minister done to forward this commitment on transportation?</p>

          <p>MR. FUREY : The rural transportation program involves 14 existing programs that this money will fund. In addition to that, there are four studies on the go in the province to expand on our rural transit program. We've reached out and we've had discussions with stakeholders, and the feedback we've been provided is consistent with the direction we're taking. In the very near future we will be releasing the allotment and disbursement of money, as well as the process for application.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : I want to thank the minister for that answer. Mr. Speaker, there are guidelines and an application process in place already, through another program called the Community Transportation Assistance Program. These guidelines specify that this specific grant, ". . . will only apply to a service in a county or region with a population density at or below 35 persons per square kilometer." I'll table that document. This means that communities like Kentville and Truro, along with municipalities like CBRM, may be excluded from the funding if these same guidelines are followed.</p>

          <p>MR. FUREY : As my colleague knows, the 14 programs I referenced are community-based initiatives. The four studies that are ongoing are community based-initiatives, and the opportunity for any community through the leadership, in consultation with their local governments, affords equal access to the funding that is available. That CTAP program funding that my colleague speaks to - an additional $500,000 a year going forward will guarantee additional funds for municipalities that support and host public transit programs as we speak. We look forward to releasing that information in the very near future.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : In recent weeks, both in Public Accounts Committee and during estimates, our caucus has asked repeatedly what the budget will be for the district health authorities' amalgamation. When Alberta merged their district health authorities into a single body there was a one-time cost, which the government has admitted will be the case here in Nova Scotia. In Alberta, for example, that cost ballooned to about $100 million, but in Nova Scotia, we still don't know that cost.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I'd have to disagree with the Minister of Health and Wellness. The budget that we're going through right now, you should reflect what the department will be spending of taxpayers' money in the coming year. As we speak today, the minister has acknowledged that this time next year the amalgamation will have happened. Certainly if the minister doesn't know what the cost of the amalgamation of the district health authorities will be today, he will have a better idea when Mr. Lee's term, as transition lead, is complete in September.</p>

At that time we will be getting closer to full implementation. During the present work that is ongoing, we in fact are getting the first glimpses that a CEO can cover off two or three of the districts, as we have currently Bruce Quigley, the CEO for Cumberland, carrying out oversight of Pictou. We'll have other examples of that as we go along, and Mr. Lee is really continuing with his current salary and we're going to find that the cost to Nova Scotians is going to be minimal over the course of the next couple of years.</p>

          <from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Acting Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. As the minister may know there are currently 51 NSLC agency stores across the province. There are over 1,100 convenience stores. The NSLC established its first eight agency stores back in 2001, and the last time any agency stores were added was in 2007, when 15 agency stores were added. As we look for ways to strengthen our rural communities, we need to look for ways to strengthen the local businesses that serve these communities. My question today for the minister is, is the minister planning on adding any new agency stores in under-serviced areas of the province?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#7577a3e3-867e-4d2e-a20f-cf0febdf9d97">
          <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, certainly the NSLC, with the support of the government over the years, has been adding agency stores to under-serviced areas. Certainly, it has been welcomed by many of those communities. If the member is aware of certain areas that are under serviced, I would strongly encourage him to bring that to the attention of either NSLC or the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, and I'm sure that that will be given due consideration.</p>

          <from>MR. HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that answer. I just want to say that adding products to the product mix of convenience stores will make them stronger and give them an opportunity to provide jobs to more local and, in most cases, rural people. In June, Mac's Convenience Stores chain in Ottawa said that 1,600 full-time jobs would be created if its 547 stores were allowed to sell alcohol. That is three new jobs for every convenience store. A study by the Ontario Convenience Stores Association argued that the government would take in more revenue from this type of move. Does the minister have any information as to how many jobs might be created in rural Nova Scotia with the addition of more agency stores?</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the member seems to be mixing up two different messages there. There are agency stores, and then there's the whole question about putting alcohol in corner stores. Those are two completely separate issues. On the question of whether we should be putting alcohol in convenience stores, while we have not looked at the economic impact, what I can say is we certainly paid very close attention to the letter provided by MADD Canada to the Leader of this Party.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Maybe I should have quit when I was ahead, when he said to just talk to the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board about it. I do want to state that I've been through the RFP that was issued back in 2006, the time the last agency stores were added. At that time, the RFP suggested they were looking for agency stores that were at least 15 kilometres driving distance from the closest NSLC, or at least 10 kilometres from any other agency store. People who live in substantial communities should have the opportunity to purchase alcohol from an agency store in their convenience stores, regardless if they are 15 kilometres from the nearest community that has a liquor store.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure my colleague, the honourable Minister of Finance and Treasury Board, would be more than open to any proposals that come forward from communities that feel they are under serviced and that would qualify for an agency store. I can tell you, when the review was done back in 2006, I know certain communities were identified as being eligible for agency stores, but unfortunately there was no update from those communities for that. At the end of the day, there needs to be a desire from the community itself that feels that it is under serviced, but let me make it very clear in case the member wasn't sure, when it comes to the issue of providing alcohol in corner stores, our government has been very clear: it's not going to happen.</p>

          <p>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Thank you to the member opposite. Obviously any time there is a bridge structure that has to be repaired, certainly those that have to be replaced as we're seeing currently with a number of spots across the province - Indian Sluice, of course Sydney River, there are many significant projects that are taking place. Of course these links are vital for transportation, they're vital for the economy, they're important to get school buses and people to and from work, and they're important for our economy and for our people, so any opportunity we take to make those repairs and changes, we have full disclosure and notification to the motoring public and, of course, the greater community.</p>

Any time there are delays, and I'm not familiar with the specifics of the bridge that the honourable member is speaking of, but certainly there are delays, it becomes a fact of life in transportation, particularly with these large-scale projects, with the design, with the engineering, and obviously the environmental assessment portion of these projects is paramount to the successful completion of the projects.</p>

At a recent HR Committee meeting, our caucus brought up that we should bring in the people who are responsible for the Bluenose II, twice - not once but twice. Both times that government over there shot them down; they didn't want them to come in, they didn't want the people of Nova Scotia to know why there's a delay in the Bluenose II, why the cost overruns are there and everything else that goes on with it. So to stand over on that side and say they're over there doing their best and they're trying to do everything they can and they're not trying to hide anything? I have a hard time with that.

It is an emotional issue, especially when we have an issue between parents and grandparents. (Interruptions) I'm getting heckled here, but I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole. What I'm going to say is, I think emotionally we believe in this bill, that grandparents are given rights. But what we have to make sure is that when given this - they say with great power comes great responsibility, and we hope that when the courts get this and they're deciding these issues as it relates to the grandparents, it sees the wholeness of the case in front of them, that the courts have the wisdom to carry this through as wished.</p>

It's important to the residents we represent to ensure that they have the ability, if something goes wrong or if something isn't what it was meant to be, to have recourse to try to get out of contracts.

          <from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of this bill. The PC caucus supports modernizing our liquor laws and giving consumers more choice. This bill is just one way we can do that. These changes will make things that much easier for small businesses in this province. The Ivany report calls for exactly this kind of change, and we as a Party stand for anything that helps small business and creates jobs. This is also why we are calling for the goals and recommendations of the Ivany report to be put into law.</p>

I would say to the honourable minister, her tenacity has certainly paid off and it probably won't be the last time it pays off.</p>

I just wanted to make note that I have written some notes down from the Opposition members' comments and would like to address a little bit, the comments around the concerns on health promotion. I just want to assure the members of the House that responsible consumption of alcohol is a concern of ours, that other members of our caucus and Cabinet have had some discussions and are working collaboratively between departments to make sure that this is on our minds.</p>
