          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Premier. The Cobequid Pass is a vital transportation link connecting Nova Scotians. It is, of course, a toll road that was introduced by a previous Liberal Government. This year is only December 12th and already the pass has been closed twice this season. I'd like to ask the Deputy Premier, will the government review maintenance and snow clearing on the Cobequid Pass to determine why it is so easily closed?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN : I thank the Leader of the Official Opposition for the question. There is no question that there have been a number of issues with the Cobequid Pass, as the member and all members of the House are well aware. The reality is it's a very tough area for winter conditions. It gets pounded with sleet and snow all the time and it's very difficult to keep the roads clear in certain weather conditions, which of course we can't control. As the member would know, there have been a number of major incidents there that have led the department to do a number of reviews and studies to try to figure out how we increase support there for commuters and make sure that we keep Nova Scotians safe.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Last week a mere four inches of snow led to another closure on the Cobequid Pass. It was the second one in a week where the previous week a four tractor trailer pileup caused the multi-hour closure of the Cobequid Pass, and I'll table the details of both closures for the minister. Mr. Speaker, will the department review road safety rules and regulations on the Cobequid Pass to ensure that they are adequate to protect the travelling public and keep the Pass open, safely, in the wintertime?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#8fad494a-14a2-43cc-9056-2453c96e522e">
          <from>MR. MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : What the member is referring to is a number of large transport vehicles that were caught in the Pass. Essentially there is a very dangerous area, probably the worst stretch of the Cobequid Pass that gets, again, bogged down with snow and sleet and all the weather that comes in the winter. What happens is the trucks can't get the speed. There are large, broad, long hills and these vehicles can't the required speed to get up these hills; they get caught halfway and then, obviously, that wreaks havoc on all commuters who are on that road.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer. I do agree with the minister, there are very hard-working crews in both Londonderry and Oxford that look after the Cobequid Pass, and they do a great job.</p>

          <from>Mr. Speaker</from>
          <p>One concern that does come up is whether there is sufficient road-clearing equipment to keep the Pass open, and I'll tell you why, Mr. Speaker : when one lane of the Cobequid Pass closes - for example, because a tractor-trailer has blocked it because of an accident - it is very important that there be adequate equipment to keep the remaining lanes open so traffic can continue to flow. In addition, when the Cobequid Pass is threatened with closure, it's important that we have equipment to keep alternative routes, like Highway No. 4 through the Wentworth Valley, open for traffic that can be diverted through the Valley.</p>

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the Opposition. This was just announced yesterday, and I can say that we've had discussions among our caucus and are very concerned about the impact this will have, particularly on seniors and people living with disabilities.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the answer. We also learned yesterday with this announcement that approximately 8,000 Canada Post workers will be losing employment over the next five years. This will have a real impact on job loss in Nova Scotia. These are good-paying full-time jobs, which this province relies on. We've already taken a hit in the last number of years with the reduction in employment in federal government agencies in Atlantic Canada, and Nova Scotia taking a disproportionate share of that hit.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, we appreciate that question. I'm glad that the issue of employment was raised because that is one of our main concerns with this change in policy. There are many postal workers in this province, and while providing an important service, they also provide a lot to our economies. These jobs are quite well-paid jobs and certainly will be missed if they are phased out in our cities.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, again I want to thank the Deputy Premier for her response. Seniors' organizations are already speaking out fairly forcefully about the impact this will have, particularly on the seniors population. In fact I heard a representative of a very large seniors' organization talk about how this will make it tougher for some seniors to stay in their own homes. The isolation that people experience as seniors is often broken by that contact through door-to-door mail delivery, where they are able to keep in contact with family and friends.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, this will be an issue for our discussions with seniors' groups. I know that the Minister of Health and Wellness, who is also the Minister of Seniors, will be including that in those discussions because this is an issue that will hit many people hard here in urban areas, not just in HRM but in other urban areas in our province. So we certainly will have that on our agenda.</p>

          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the honourable Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. The fate of Highland Consolidated Middle School in Westville is an issue that directly affects more than 200 families and dozens of staff living in Pictou East, but it also indirectly affects all the residents of the Town of Westville and surrounding areas.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, thank you to the member for the question. I'm very familiar with Highland Consolidated and the move of the students out of that school into W.A. MacLeod which, of course, caused that to become a P to 8 school. The school board and school community have recognized that the facilities in W.A. MacLeod are not adequate to accommodate a junior high population, and so there has been a request from the school board to the department to consider renovations to W.A. MacLeod to accommodate that junior high population. I know the study committee is currently working in the community and I would encourage the member to ensure that his concerns get to that study group, either through the SAC or some other way so that they have that information, those concerns regarding the junior high population, which at this time is currently housed in a P to 8 facility.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her comments and would recognize that I have been to all the community meetings. I also met with the staff and students at that school and toured it on different times. The issue for me is, while the building sits empty, school goes on. Currently, the middle school students are housed in the upper level of an elementary school, and these facilities are not age-appropriate for these Grade 7 and Grade 8 students. The school board has applied to the province for $3.5 million to additions and alterations funding to make the existing building more suitable.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, as the member would know, the request comes from the school board to the department. We are currently working on our capital plan for the next school year. We expect that there will be a release of a capital plan before the end of this calendar year, and any capital projects that we have will be there. But I'm fully aware of the request. I understand the importance it has to the students to make sure that they have an appropriate setting, in particular for the junior high students, and that request from the board to the department has been received and is being reviewed and considered.</p>

          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her thoughtful, thorough answer there. I know the staff will be relieved to know that they'll be receiving an answer before the end of the calendar year. So the community is looking for a permanent solution, but they do recognize that this will take time. The students of Highland Consolidated have been unfairly disadvantaged because they have not had access to the same standard of education facilities as those students at other middle schools.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, when there was a request that went out from the former minister to ask boards to discontinue their school review process, the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board was one of the ones that chose to move forward with a couple of their projects, recognizing that a delay would seriously impact on the students' education program. Both schools that have been mentioned by the member were part of that process, so I think that should tell the member that the school board and the department both recognize that appropriate facilities for our students for academic programming are a priority.</p>

My question to the minister is, when the minister meets with the residents and this particular association, will this particular meeting happen in the area where he'll have an opportunity to see what's happening with the fly ash, the damage it's causing to vehicles and homes and gardens in the surrounding areas, or will this meeting be here in Halifax?</p>

          <p>HON. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, one of the first steps we took when I became Minister of Energy was to set up the meeting with Mr. Boyles and the Hillside and Trenton group. As he would be aware, and this member may be aware, I tried to get repeated meetings with the previous government over this very issue. Mr. Boyles asked for the meeting to be held in Halifax so that the Minister of Health and Wellness and the Minister of Environment could be in attendance at that meeting, as well as departmental staff. That is happening within, I think it's the first two weeks of January. I've already been out personally to see Mr. Boyles and see there. I have stacks of pictures. I've seen the evidence, and this is a high priority. We've also raised the issue with Nova Scotia Power already and asked them to present us with a plan to address these issues.</p>

Their current pay scale for this group of employees is actually $14.80 to $15.42 an hour. Once an employee in this pay range surrenders their deductions, their benefits, and taxes and EI, they're making about $10 an hour take-home pay.

While going door to door, however, seniors I talked to were actually pleased about the fact that there was a commitment to financially assist seniors with hearing aids that couldn't afford those hearing aids, and it's a big problem throughout the province.

I certainly hope that that answer didn't mean no, because my understanding is that during the election, the candidates for the Liberals had told people throughout the province that they were going to keep with commitments that were coming forth from the government. I would like to also talk about the fact that hearing properly is so important to seniors, for them to be able to participate more fully in society and interact with their loved ones, their families. So it certainly does enhance their quality of life. And also, not being able to hear properly is a health and safety issue.</p>

        <heading>TIR: DOUBLE CHIP SEAL - EFFECTIVENESS</heading>
        <speech by="#df5cd31f-e29e-4872-a6af-347b750f2f73">
          <from>MR. TIM HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. TIM HOUSTON : My question this afternoon is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Mr. Speaker, under the NDP's road strategy, we saw a significant increase in the amount of roads chip sealed and double chip sealed. Today I want to talk about double chip sealing. If you live in rural Nova Scotia, you now know that double chip sealing means that your road is going to be de-paved; they are going to pulverize your payment and turn it into double chip sealed road, which is essentially a gravel road. The NDP felt that double chip sealing roads was better than patching them. My question for the minister this morning is, does he agree that double chip sealing is an effective tool and will the minister continue to use it aggressively?</p>

          <from>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>HON. GEOFF MACLELLAN : This is something that has been an important topic for us as we look at the capital plan moving forward and how we're going to accomplish looking after the roads for Nova Scotians. Obviously we do our very best with the large-scale capital projects that we have for highways as well as the local roads, and again, we're trying to accomplish as much as we can with, obviously, a limited budget.</p>

          <from>MR. HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. I do agree that there may be applications for double chip sealing in the process, but I'm just curious about how those decisions are made. I mean, essentially, if you bought a house on a paved road in rural Nova Scotia, you might now be living on a gravel road, and that has disappointed a lot of residents in my constituency. I'm thinking in particular of the residents of the Marsh Road in Thorburn. The Marsh Road was scheduled to be paved in 2014, but instead, interestingly, was double chip sealed just before the writ dropped. So I know that there are many variables that come into play in deciding whether a road should be chip sealed or double chip sealed, and presumably it's things like traffic volume and the number of houses on a road.</p>

          <from>MR. MACLELLAN</from>
          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. You know, the reality is, again, that we're doing our very best to keep roads as healthy and as stable as possible. There are a number of categories for roads, whether or not, in what year they were built originally and what maintenance was performed. The member is absolutely correct, there's a formula. A lot of it has to do with the amount of traffic in those areas, number of homes and whatnot, but I can say to the member that I would certainly be willing to meet with him about this specific road.</p>

          <from>MR. HOUSTON</from>
          <p>MR. HOUSTON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his answer. Now, in terms of roads that have already been double chip sealed, I can tell you that a couple of weeks ago we started getting a number of calls into our constituency office about the slippery condition of these roads. This is even really before we started the winter season. So there's a big issue developing in that double chip sealed roads can't be salted. They have to be sanded, and sand is only loaded into the trucks after all the roads have been salted. So you can imagine how this really diminishes the winter service level of the people who live on double chip sealed roads. It impacts their lives.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I have a question on the Affordable Living Tax Credit for the Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. Cost of living increases in the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security for a senior couple can push them over the $30,000 threshold and result in a clawback of this benefit. Will the minister index the threshold to eliminate the clawback to maintain the spirit for which this tax credit was created?</p>

I think the members of the House are aware that we'll be looking at not only taxes, but fees and regulations as well. It's a large project, and it will be undertaken beginning in January.

This issue was brought to me by a couple in my constituency, and I have no doubt that members from all across the province have constituents who are affected by this. It was created and built into a past budget model. Good fiscal management should make it part of the upcoming Spring budget at the amount it was originally intended for.

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, it is a concern to us; 50 per cent of Nova Scotians fit into the lowest tax bracket, actual taxable income in the lowest tax bracket, so we're aware of the fiscal pressures and the difficulty of people trying very hard to work hard and have a decent life here in Nova Scotia. Certainly measures to alleviate poverty are important to us, and they actually cross jurisdictions, they cross different departments. We'll be working collectively to try to build the best possible plan for the coming year.</p>

It's making life less affordable. One final question for the minister, can the minister give us some hope that this government will be different from the previous government come the Spring budget?</p>

One of the areas that seniors now feel a great need to speak often about is their health and wellness issues.

          <p>MS. KARLA MACFARLANE : I was honoured to speak about this bill a couple of weeks ago and I just want to say we all live in a beautiful province and it is really our responsibility to maintain that. This bill will definitely ensure that Nova Scotia is being responsible to its citizens, which we definitely always should be. With fracking comes waste water. If Nova Scotia isn't ready for fracking then we aren't ready to process waste water. I want to say that our caucus has taken a very clear position on hydraulic fracturing from the very beginning. We will not support fracking in this province unless there is scientific proof that it will not endanger our groundwater. Our caucus supports the moratorium on fracking and will maintain that support until we are shown scientific evidence.</p>

This was something that was done in the past, a couple of years ago. For those of you who don't know, it was put into the Avon River. Of course that stirred up a lot of people and still tests were done and you can be doing tests for years because you really don't know what this all takes in.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Mr. Speaker, I, too, am pleased to see this bill come forward, although as I did mention in the Law Amendments Committee the other day, it doesn't address the issue of transporting this hazardous waste material from place to place within Nova Scotia. It only addresses it coming in from outside of the province. So the same problems can occur if it's being transported by trucks or whatever, or even by trains, within the province. I think we need to pay attention to that and I would hope that the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Energy are both paying careful attention to this as well.</p>

The member for Argyle-Barrington raised the issue that the Liberal caucus was against the project in Opposition. Of course, he knows that is false, and we tabled pages of Hansard by myself and the Leader showing us repeatedly speaking in favour of the project in Opposition. As well, what we raised were the impacts to Nova Scotians in terms of risks. I remember very clearly the issues we brought up. We said what happens if there's an issue with the water management rights? What happens if there's an issue in the Northern Pass or with the northern clays? What happens if the project is delayed?</p>

I can tell you, though, what the difference in that spread will be and the spread shows that the price will be cheaper than the average generation cost to Nova Scotia, which means despite the fact that - the member opposite says we will still be burning coal for many years to come, that's absolutely true. That's absolutely true, but the fact is the other day, on December 3rd, the generation cost of coal was still more expensive than the cost would have been under the Maritime Link surplus power, which means that brings the average price of power down.</p>

The amendments to the Executive Council Act and Public Service Act are necessary to establish the new Treasury and Policy Board, and update language in the Act to reflect this change and recent changes to department names and mandates. The majority of these amendments formalize changes we have already announced. The others simply update and align provisions in the two acts. But these are an important step to allow us to move forward and get to the work that Nova Scotians want us to do, so I am pleased that they are moving forward in a timely manner. Thank you.</p>

          <p>HON. LENA DIAB : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to move Bill No. 14 for third reading, and just want to stress for the House that these amendments that are proposed in the bill were set out as the result of a Supreme Court of Nova Scotia ruling that demanded that we have a fair compensation process for the Justices of the Peace, and we believe we've done that with this amendment. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MS. LENORE ZANN : Mr. Speaker, I stand in my place today on third reading of this particular bill. I was in the Law Amendments Committee meeting and I heard the people come and give their presentations. In fact, when asked, the gentleman who was representing all of the different businesses, who had concerns when this bill was first brought to the House, said not one of those businesses has actually been affected, not one of those businesses has lost business, not one of them has left the province.</p>

          <p>MS. ZANN : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Also, I just want to say that in the two short months that the Liberal Party has been in government, it has been very difficult to be clear about where they stand when it comes to both business and labour. In fact, just in the Law Amendments Committee the other day, when these businesses came forward to say that they were not happy about the holiday in February and that this was not good for small businesses or medium-size businesses and that they were not consulted - that sends one sign to some of the people in Nova Scotia, yet this particular bill sends another signal to the workers of Nova Scotia that, in fact, business is more important to this government than labour.</p>

Many people in the Gaelic community are disappointed with this and that it was done without consultation. Now I certainly wish no ill will towards Queen Elizabeth II or the Royal Family. I do know, as well, that especially during times like Remembrance Day, many people in my area sing God Save the Queen.
