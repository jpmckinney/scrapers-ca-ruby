          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, on March 21st the Premier visited Amherst to speak to the chamber of commerce there. Many people from Cumberland County attended looking for answers as to why there has been such a long delay in completing the forensic audit of the Cumberland Regional Development Authority, or CRDA. The Premier told them there will be more information soon, and I'm glad to know he is on top of the issue. This is a $200,000 audit, reviewing nearly $20 million of taxpayers' money, and it is almost a year late, a delay that has been attributed to a local law firm, Hicks LeMoine, which was withholding key audit evidence.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : This audit started in January 2013 and obviously we are quite concerned as to the length of time that this audit has taken. I do believe that the Leader of the Opposition may be incorrect with some of the assumptions that he does make but I can advise him that the issue relating to any evidence that was being held by the law firm in question has been turned over to the auditors but there are other issues that they are reviewing as well.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : I certainly invite the minister to provide more information so that people in Cumberland County, including their representative, have all the facts to judge exactly what is going on. Mr. Speaker, holding back audit evidence is wrong. It is particularly wrong when taxpayers' money is involved. The delay in this case has been attributed publicly to Hicks LeMoine, the law firm for CRDA.</p>

We look forward to seeing these results as soon as possible. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, again, this audit began in January 2013, under a previous administration in this province.</p>

It was brought to the floor of the House yesterday that the employer, Capital Health, is calling in a number of nurses who have taken illegal job action, so it is the right of the employer to question whether or not - why that illegal job action had taken place and we wait to hear the outcome of the conversation.</p>

Capital Health has actually called the employees to meet with them, and I would encourage them to meet with their employer so that we can continue to move down the road, ensuring that essential services are in place.

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the only person hiding today is a Minister of the Crown who will not tell taxpayers of Nova Scotia whether he used their money to pay a law firm to do what they ought to have done anyway for free. I'm not actually questioning the motives of the firm, I'm questioning whether the government itself used our money to get something that should be available to the auditor at no charge. It seems pretty simple to me. The minister is not going to answer the question, the audit has been going on for a year and a half, all Nova Scotians want to know is what really happened to their money in the case of CRDA. There's no good reason why that audit should take a year and a half - the Royal Bank is audited in less than 50 days every year and it's 1,000 times the size of CRDA, yet here we are still waiting.</p>

So my question to the minster is, can Nova Scotians feel safe when the Deputy Chief Medical Health Officer says our system does not work in the current environment?</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : After Public Accounts Committee today I did have a session with the department officials because I do want that kind of assurance that I can tell Nova Scotians that, in fact, we have a good system, but it is a good system that needs to be modernized and updated. We have not found our records wanting when they have been called upon to provide good information, appropriate information, and in as reasonable a time as some of the manual record keeping is able to provide.</p>

          <p>MR. GORDIE GOSSE : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Justice. On March 30, 2011, the previous government announced a system for reporting major incidents at the Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. According to the policy, any assault committed by a person in custody against another person within a correctional facility while in custody of sheriff's services or while in court, resulting in serious injury that requires in-patient hospitalization, must be reported.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. When trying to analyze a disease, understanding how it is being spread, where it is being spread, and to whom it is being spread are key determinants in how we fight said disease.</p>

          <p>HON. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, what I can assure the member for Hants West is that we have a system that is as good and as strong as any in the country. Only Quebec and Ontario have even started down the road of electronic systems of surveillance around disease. If we take a look at H1N1 and the response of our province and when that was handed over to the Department of Health and Wellness specialists in the crisis centre, and how quickly we mobilized our officials to get the vaccination out, I think that incident alone speaks very strongly about the kind of work that is being done at Health and Wellness around disease control.</p>

I'm pleased to say that we are active on the file of getting an e-record that would be very quickly able to isolate a cohort in the population that could be most impacted by a particular communicable disease. While we're not there yet, the records that we have, the people in place at the Department of Health and Wellness, as was identified by Dr. Frank Atherton today, who is the deputy in the department in that area of medical health, a public health official - I think we can be well assured here in our province that we would be as timely as any other part of Canada in responding.</p>

The Building Canada Fund, the Gateway funds, these large-scale, infrastructure programs - we've set an agreement in a certain time for a certain amount of money. That money is guaranteed from the federal government. What we do when we complete projects is we estimate when those projects will be completed, and then we forecast the money received based on that. I have never said that the federal government reduced money. I've said that those projects and those infrastructure programs are invaluable for the people of Nova Scotia, and we'll continue to work with our federal partners on those.</p>

Last weekend I attended the annual general meeting of the Nova Scotia Cattle Producers Association, in which we enjoyed a lovely dinner of beef grown right in Cumberland North. At that meeting I talked to some farmers there who own small, mixed-farming operations that sell organic meat and produce to local markets. These are family operations, where the owners and their families perform all of the functions required to produce their goods and get them to market.</p>

We've directed our staff to help the individuals who do apply and the farms that do make applications, to help them with those applications if there's any difficulty. From what I hear from my staff, it's the first time in many, many years that they have had so many people coming into the offices, calls to visit the farms and to go out and actually participate and help them do the documentation. I think we have made a very important step forward. It's a change that I made immediately after becoming minister, and it gives more accountability and easier access to these important programs for farms of all sizes.</p>

It's one that I was aware of before the election was actually called, but it's one where the funding was not explicitly made available as part of that announcement. It was a deferred expense proposed by the previous government, and it's one with respect to how we're proceeding with our programs and services as part of the budget process that this House and the estimates committee has been going through. Certainly that's part of what is being evaluated as part of that process in budgeting.</p>

          <p>MS. ZANN : Well Mr. Speaker, that answer does not make me feel very confident with this government going forward because, as we know, most Nova Scotians have oil tanks and that is how they heat their houses. In fact, we have about 200,000 domestic oil tanks, and tanks that are in poor condition are the leading cause of oil spills. Oil spills can cost tens of thousands of dollars to clean up, something which low-income families just simply can't afford. Therefore my question to the minister is, what is the minister's message to Nova Scotians who want to prevent oil spills but needed the support from the province in order to do so?</p>

          <p>MR.

We do have a wide number of programs and services offered to help with various household improvements that are available within the province and certainly my messaging is to look at all programs and services offered by the government.

I know, and the Minister of Energy knows, that the overall plan initially did not call for the redevelopment of the fifth floor of the Dartmouth General.

Perhaps the minister missed some news out of his department that he is responsible for, but there is quite a significant contract that has to do with provincial landline telephone business and it could be a contract worth up to $64 million, so there is some controversy over how that tendering process was followed with the bid team. Sadly, this isn't the first time serious questions have been raised about the tendering process for government contracts under the Liberal Administration.

What I found out is that some of the other provinces still have it. Through the various discussions I've had with the federal Minister of Immigration, I've made it very clear that Nova Scotia is not satisfied with the CEC federal stream and that we intend to ask them to market the stream for the Province of Nova Scotia because, at the moment, the marketing strategy is not working for us provincially when it comes to these international students.</p>

          <from>MR. JOHN LOHR</from>
          <p>MR. JOHN LOHR : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture. We have over 5,000 food establishments in this province and we have 24 public health inspectors who are responsible for inspecting those establishments. That equals out to about 210 places per inspector.</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Indeed, we do over 10,000 inspections a year and there are some discrepancies, as has been reported in the paper, and that's understandable. Indeed, the numbers of infractions that are found are a small portion of the actual inspections that are done.</p>

          <from>MR. LOHR</from>
          <p>MR. LOHR : I'd like to thank the minister for that answer. Mr. Speaker, a basic requirement of the provincial regulation is that every licensed establishment must have food safety training, however not all restaurants are meeting that requirement. One that was pointed out in that article was a business in New Minas where five inspections took place between February 2012 and January this year and not once did the owner/operator have the required training - once again that was in that April 11th article. Does this concern the minister? Why would five inspections have taken place that had failed and no disciplinary action has been handed down?</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : I cannot comment on any individual inspection on any restaurant because it still may be under investigation. In the event that there are violations, fines will be levied and corrective action will be taken.</p>

          <p>MR. LOHR : It is my understanding that warnings were handed down in that case but evidently they are not working too effectively. In fact, 27 food operations were issued, in some cases multiple warnings. A Halifax food establishment was cited six times in the past year for lack of trained staff and a Windsor business has been cited over 30 times, since May 2011, for multiple violations, including lack of trained staff.</p>

          <p>MR. COLWELL : Our department works closely with the restaurant association and also our inspectors are instructed to cite violations - if indeed they are violations - and they try to work closely with the restaurants to make sure that these violations are corrected. If they are not corrected, appropriate action will be taken, and have been taken in the past. Anyone who wants to see what the violations are or how restaurants stack up in violations, they can go on the government website and see very clearly where the inspection was done and the results of the inspections. They are all public.</p>

          <from>MR. KEITH IRVING</from>
          <p>MR. KEITH IRVING : Mr. Speaker, what an incredible week for Yarmouth and for the Province of Nova Scotia. We have all been part of something special. Yesterday the Nova Star sailed into harbour for the first time, and she is truly impressive. Our government promised we'd do all we could to get a ferry service back to Yarmouth, and we made that promise because we saw the impact of the loss of the ferry in 2009. We know a ferry service will help spur the economy, and we know it is a gateway for tourists.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, if they would let me have the opportunity to speak as we gave them the opportunity, I'm on the list. The fact is that it was the NDP Government that did negotiate this new deal to bring the Nova Star to our province, and I am going to explain to you, Mr. Speaker, what happened.</p>

          <p>Mr. Speaker, I am saying here that this is my opportunity. Nobody said anything to the members opposite, so they should give us the same consideration. We are explaining a situation. They don't want Nova Scotians to know about it because they're trying to take credit for something that they didn't do, which takes place every day in this House. So, Mr. Speaker :Interruptions)</p>

          <from>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE</from>
          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, they can think whatever they want; I'm talking about facts. The fact was that, at the time, when you looked at the hotel rates for overnight vacancy, they started going down way before 2009. So there was a decline, and there were reasons behind that. The reasons were the fact that the Canadian dollar was very strong, we were running into an economic downturn and the CAT ferry, I believe that (Interruptions) no, there were travellers on it, but the number of travellers also was going down. We know that that ferry system was not the appropriate ferry system.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : I hope that this government thinks - if they think they're going to have a free ride for four years, they're going to have very difficult decisions to make too. If they think they're 100 per cent perfect, well then good luck to them, because we are human beings, we make decisions on the information that's provided at that time and at least the fact is the NDP has the ability to tell people in Nova Scotia that they could have done a better job on that. We did say that, that it was something where we should have had a better transitional plan.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : I find that for those members to - I know they're happy, and I'm glad that they're happy for the new ferry. I am glad that the member for Yarmouth is able to celebrate with his community. Of course I'm glad and happy for Nova Scotians. I know it's something that Nova Scotians felt very strongly about. That is why we went back to the table to try to resolve something that we feel that we could have done a better job on. But I think Nova Scotians appreciate any politician that gets up in this House and says, yes, we did make a mistake in terms of the transition, not a mistake on the type of ferry. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, first I want to congratulate the member for Kings South for bringing forward this resolution about, not the Yarmouth ferry, but the Nova Scotian ferry, the ferry that does for all of us. (Applause) I sat here and I listened to our colleague from the far left say her piece about how there was a depression. That is a fact. Of course, by cancelling the ferry, it only helped the depression to get worse in that community. This same government brought in higher power rates that helped the depression. That same government, the NDP Government, brought in higher taxes that helped the depression, and that's a fact. This is what the member likes to talk about. (Interruption) Now, that's not a fact.</p>

The member opposite, the Liberal Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, suggested that no NDP member was re-elected on October 8th in proximity to Yarmouth, concerning the ferry. I want to reassure you that I've been elected three times. I am the closest NDP member to Yarmouth, from Shelburne. I remain seated. Thank you very much.</p>
