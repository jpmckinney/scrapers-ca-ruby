It sets out the potential for some $1.5 billion of investment in our province through renewable projects. There are many different streams for that. It provides the best opportunity for the development of renewables into the grid.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it allows the monopoly with the only access in this province and does not allow Nova Scotians to have a choice when it comes to purchasing their power. The Electricity Marketplace Governance Committee made Recommendation 51. It was accepted, applauded throughout the energy sector, except by Nova Scotia Power.</p>

This is what the Liberal Party wants to see, they want to see what happened in Ontario where bills went up by 30 per cent. They want to see what happened in Alberta. So for the information of the Leader of the Official Opposition, I want to read to him what his colleague said in Hansard back in November 2002. This is now Premier Dalton McGuinty said, ". . . now that there is a broad consensus right across the country that this has been one of the most glaring examples of gross mismanagement and incompetence, why not admit it? Deregulation is dead; the market is dead; your experiment has been an abject failure." That is what the Liberal Party wants for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, last Friday Capital Health Local 42 ratified their agreement with the government so there is now an agreement. The Premier has either calculated the full cost of that agreement to the government or he has not and if he has not, then we have a bigger problem than him refusing to share the cost of that agreement with all Nova Scotians. So I'll ask the Premier today, now that there is an agreement in place, now that the vote is over, now that the agreement has been ratified by the local, will he now commit to sharing with Nova Scotians the full cost of that agreement, including all benefits, pensions and other concessions that may have been made to reach this point?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party would know, it is still in the hands of an arbitrator and that decision will actually affect the cost to the province, but I can tell him in general terms, I didn't do that last week because the matter was still up for ratification and if there was no ratification, then everything would have been out the window and we would be essentially starting again, but the cost in that local will range anywhere between $3.3 million and $4.9 million depending on the decision that the arbitrator makes on the positioning of those percentages.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Well, Mr. Speaker, we're making some progress and I want to thank the Premier for sharing those numbers, finally, with all Nova Scotians. Of course, he's speaking only about that one particular local but, as he would know from his own experience, that will be multiplied across many other bargaining units because that is the lead bargaining unit that sets the pattern for these kind of arrangements, but in the case of this particular local in Capital Health, the negotiation was led by David Collins. It was assisted by a provincial conciliator, John Greer. The negotiations continued right up until the end and over 500 surgeries were cancelled and many other procedures were either scrapped or postponed.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, negotiations take place on the basis of confidentiality, as was pointed out over the course of the negotiations, with a blackout. Frequently things like the negotiating mandate, those kinds of things come back to the government for commentary and support, if necessary. What I want Nova Scotians to know is that the management of the health negotiations were carried out in a very professional manner. They were done with purpose. They followed a predictable course and we have a result which is satisfactory to the government.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, all Nova Scotians know what happened at the official negotiating table. They followed it very closely. They followed the actions of Mr. Collins and the conciliator in this example. What they don't know is what other discussions behind the scenes might have been going on between the Premier's Office and Local 42 and, with respect, with answers like that, I guess we'll never know.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the district health authorities have made their budget proposals on the basis of a 1 per cent cost to them of new contracts. They, of course, will expect that that will be supported, and it will be, but we will be in conversation with the district health authorities on this matter. This depends on the decision of the arbitrator, as you would know, we anticipate these matters in advance, we set aside money to fund contract negotiations and before those kinds of decisions can be fully made we would have to know what the extent of the cost would be.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, power rates have soared. People are struggling, businesses are closing and the NDP continue to pass the buck to the Utility and Review Board. Government's lack of action is forcing Nova Scotians to decide between keeping the heat on or feeding their families and government is clearly out of touch with reality of Nova Scotia families. My question to the Premier is, why is government content to hide behind the URB as Nova Scotians struggle to pay their power bills?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, far from it. This government has been as active, or more active, than governments over the last 20 years. We have put in place a comprehensive renewable energy strategy that is designed to create stability in energy pricing. We have taken the HST off of home energy, something that was voted against by the Liberal Party, if they had their way home energy costs would be even higher.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, he has been active all right, power bills have gone up more than 20 per cent under his leadership. Not to mention the NDP electricity tax. The government is not fond of discussing their NDP electricity tax, a tax, quite frankly, they opposed before coming into office. Government's demand side management fee is costing Nova Scotians $40 million. That's $40 million directly attached to the NDP electricity tax that's coming out of the pockets of Nova Scotians. This government is clearly directly responsible for those increases in the power bills. My question to the Premier is, why does he continue to sit idly by as Nova Scotians struggle to pay their power bills by adding the electricity tax?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : First of all there is no NDP electricity tax, it was the NDP that took the tax off of electricity, he has got to get that right. Now, Mr. Speaker, what he is talking about, though, is the demand side management charge, and as a result of the demand side management charge there has been an investment in Nova Scotia that has saved tens of millions of dollars for consumers. It has resulted in a $40 million investment in the economy that allowed companies to create jobs in the province, this has been very successful. I cannot believe the Liberal Party that used to be - at one time, long ago - champions of conservation, and now don't want it to happen.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I can understand why the Premier doesn't want to talk about the NDP electricity tax because it is a direct charge on every power bill in the Province of Nova Scotia that is directly responsible by the Premier of Nova Scotia. As a matter of fact, in 2009 a letter to the Utility and Review Board the NDP wrote it " . . . places the burden of DSM-related improvements too heavily on residential users and other rates classes." Later in the letter it went on, ". . . this surcharge on their power bills at this juncture would add unneeded and counter-productive costs to residential and business users." And I want to add, since then power rates have gone up by more than 20 per cent since that crew got into power. This is a tax on the poor, middle class in this province, so my question to the Premier, why does the Premier believe that Nova Scotians should pay the NDP electricity tax instead of Nova Scotia Power shareholders?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I just keep reminding the Leader of the Opposition that it's the NDP that took the tax off of electricity, it was something that they opposed. If they had their choice Nova Scotians would be paying even more for electricity than they are. The reason why electricity costs have gone up is because we have a utility that over the years has been shackled to the price of fossil fuels. As a result of that, as a result of bad decisions made by former governments, both Liberals and Tories, we are stuck with the utility that we have. But they are changing, they are changing with a better portfolio mix, with more renewables so that we can have stable power rates into the future.</p>

We're talking about consultation. I know that Party over there does not even know the definition of consultation and we are not going back and forth. We are opening up the doors to all people of Nova Scotia in the future to talk to us about early childhood development and where the province and the people of Nova Scotia would like to see that go.

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Certainly we're all concerned about the cost of electricity and the demands on consumers and small businesses and industrials. There are many factors that go in to determine that cost and the rate of return. The cost to executives is only a small part of what is considered by the URB in determining what's fair and what's right and the best possible price for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, again through the process in the Department of Energy and this government, we worked hard to bring down prices or hold them stable. We've taken the provincial portion of the HST off electricity and we've had the Keep the Heat program. We're working on conservation programs through Efficiency Nova Scotia, we have built a strong portfolio of renewables in this province around wind and biomass and hydroelectricity, and we've introduced natural gas. Unlike previous governments that relied on only one thing - coal was all they looked at - we've got a great diversity in this government.</p>

Almost all of these ads are political in nature and could just as easily come from the New Democratic Party rather than the Government of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotians pay taxes to pay for services (Interruptions) Pardon me? There you go.

The province's GDP grew by 0.3 per cent last year under this great government. We can't wait to hear how the Liberals and the Tories are responsible for last year's failures in economic development.

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, businesses are having to deal with rising power costs far too frequently. It's another cost pressure that is making our economy uncompetitive and the proof is no further than our dismal economic growth last year. Manufacturing output dropped by $5.6 million, construction declined by 6.5 per cent. Small- and medium-sized businesses are being squeezed by an overall uncompetitive environment, however, business after business points to power as their very top concern. My question to the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, or whatever minister wants to read the bullets, why has the minister ignored the detrimental effects that rising power rates have had on our businesses and on the economy of Nova Scotia?</p>

Coal prices have been up 75 per cent in the last six years. This government has taken action to get away from that, to do something different than previous governments with a whole portfolio of renewables and conservation and natural gas and other initiatives. It is because of years of inaction by previous governments that we are in the situation that we're in right now.</p>

While the national economy expanded by 2.6 per cent, our province was virtually flat at 0.3 per cent GDP growth.

The Premier and the minister, his government generally, have been very good at following the bullet points on the Lower Churchill project as a beacon of hope for energy costs in this province.

As I mentioned in my previous answer, getting off of fossil fuels and getting off of coal. Certainly the Muskrat Falls project provides Nova Scotians with access to reliable power for 35 years, it will help to stabilize prices here for that length of time.

Of course, it very much depends on the overall structure of the cost. In order to be able to determine the overall cost for ratepayers you have to be able to determine the overall cost structure to begin with. Since that hasn't happened yet it's very difficult to be able to provide him with the information that he requires.</p>

In his news release of November 18, 2010 - which I will table, of course - the Premier repeatedly talks about how the Lower Churchill project will deliver power at a rate that is initially higher than coal but will then balance out. He makes all kinds of statements about how the cost will be good for Nova Scotians, and yet he doesn't know that. He doesn't know how it will compare to other elements, and these are important elements for Nova Scotians to understand.</p>

This legislation acknowledges that grandparents are an important part of the lives of their grandchildren. It also acknowledges the power of the court to take and assess and evaluate each and every case on its own merits which is a critical element I think in our justice system. It explicitly adds a reference to grandparents as having the ability to apply for access or custody and allows the appropriate body to make that decision - our courts.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : It's my pleasure to stand and speak for a few moments on Bill No. 59, the Fish Harvesters Registration and Certification Board Act - seems a really long handle on that one. I said this many times in this Legislature that the best thing about our fishing industry in Nova Scotia is its independence. I've always said, too, that the worst thing about our fishing industry in Nova Scotia is, of course, its independence, because it has always been very difficult to get everybody to agree on something to move forward.</p>

I think Nova Scotians should be concerned about government trying to pass on messaging through that channel.</p>

The only thing I would like to wrap up is this bill is not a bad bill by any stretch of the imagination, it's a good idea. It's a bill that will enable municipalities to provide financing for solar panels and some renewable energy things. The only issue that I have with it and I think that indeed the municipalities would probably have with it too, is if there was a program through Efficiency Nova Scotia they wouldn't have to do this, they just simply wouldn't have to do it.</p>
