          <p>HON. MARILYN MORE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to report that our government is continuing to make improvements that help keep Nova Scotia workers safe. The safety of Nova Scotia workers is a priority for this government. Every Nova Scotian who gets up and goes to work in the morning should return home safely to their family.</p>

          <from>Mr. Speaker</from>
          <p>This is our focus, Mr. Speaker : protecting Nova Scotians in the workplace. Administrative penalties are an important tool in accomplishing that goal. We need to make sure that those penalties are having the intended impact as we continue to improve safety for Nova Scotians, and that is why I'm announcing a review of the administrative penalties. It is now time to take a step back and evaluate what is working well and what can be improved.</p>

          <from>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL</from>
          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank the minister for her comments that were provided earlier today. I do believe this is a helpful step forward on this issue. Workplace safety is paramount in the Province of Nova Scotia. I know that every Party in this House wants a robust workplace safety regimen in the Province of Nova Scotia because we want our people to be safe. However, we have been hearing from businesses, as I am sure the minister has as well, that the way the penalties are currently levied aren't quite helpful. When you add those to the high power rates that we have in this province, the increased taxes as a result of this government's tax hike, increased user fees, it makes the business climate a bit less competitive here.</p>

          <p>MR. SPEAKER : Thank you. Earlier in the proceedings I wanted to advise the members that I noticed a petition that was tabled today that was the same as the one tabled on Monday.

I have instructed the Chief Clerk to return the portion that is photocopied to the member. Photocopies of petitions are not able to be tabled in the House.</p>

STEPHEN MCNEIL : Today the Auditor General released the Fall 2012 report and in the report the auditor writes, "Trade Centre Limited does not have an adequate internal control framework or sufficiently rigorous financial management practices."

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : My question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Today the Auditor General reported that Capital Health had proposed a project to the minister's department that would save all Nova Scotians $3 million each and every year. Mr. Speaker, that's a $3 million opportunity for savings that could be put into actual better health care delivery but it was rejected by the minister's department. It's time to stop wasting these opportunities to save money and actually make health care better, so my question to the minister is this; can he explain why his department rejected an opportunity to save taxpayers $3 million in health care?</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Well Mr. Speaker, there's a lot I could say with that question from the Progressive Conservative Party. Anybody who has wasted money with health care - it was the former government. They have put this province in a financial position that has limited future investments.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'll just table for the benefit of the minister, the message from the Finance Minister for the financial statements for 2009 which reported that the province was in a surplus position of $19.7 million when he and his gang took over.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, what we rejected when we came into government were the practices of the former government. We recognize the importance of investing appropriately in health care. We've worked extremely hard over the last three years to ensure that we make the right investments, especially in health care but in all departments across government because we were left a financial mess. But we're going to clean it up.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the government inherited a surplus of $19.7 million, according to the Auditor General - the same one who is now criticizing this minister and his department. It would be great if the minister would actually speak to his own term in office.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, based on today's Auditor General Report, we have learned that the Health and Wellness Department's level of IT security is weak at present, ". . . an unnecessarily high risk from internal threats. The overall level of control is inadequate and must be improved."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : In fact, Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite is true. Shortly after coming into government, we undertook an analysis of just exactly these kinds of difficulties. In fact, we've passed the Personal Health Information Act, which is going to come into force in December, and it will resolve many of the problems that the Auditor General has identified.</p>

There is a program of implementation, that's underway.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, no surprise at the misrepresentation of what the Auditor General actually said. What the Auditor General was concerned with is actually internal security where people who are working in the system have access that they shouldn't have. That is exactly the kind of fixes that we're putting in place. The overall security from people for outside was not part of the criticism that was being levelled in the AG's Report. As I pointed out, we actually did the work to identify this, we brought forward the legislation, we've put in place an implementation plan which we are implementing, and in December, I believe, we will be able to actually bring forward that legislation in full and resolve the very issues the AG has pointed to.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, again, no surprise the information put forward by the Leader of the Official Opposition is wrong. It's actually a floor, so what Nova Scotia receives will not go down, but nonetheless we are concerned about transfers and health transfers in particular. In this country it is the Atlantic Provinces that have the oldest population, and therefore the ones who are likely to see the greatest deal of stress on the system as we go forward.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, with that answer it's little wonder the Premier has said very little about what the federal government is doing to health care transfers to the Province of Nova Scotia. It's going down because it's not being adjusted for inflation. In any other place, that means it's going down and Nova Scotians lose.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Again, Mr. Speaker, the information just asserted by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. In fact, the plan is to adjust for inflation. The problem is that inflation does not actually represent what the increasing costs in health care are. So that's part of the problem: it has been a retrenchment from the manner in which it has been done before. We, of course, have made this absolutely clear to the federal government, and certainly in my role as chair of the Council of the Federation - when we talk with all of the other Premiers, and I'm pleased to represent them in discussions with the federal government - we make these points regularly.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. The Auditor General reported today that the Health and Wellness Department budgeted zero dollars for health equipment this year, a fact that just defies common sense, and as a result, the department has had to raid its own emergency fund to pay for health equipment needs across our health system.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Yet again, Mr. Speaker, it's just not true what the member opposite is talking about. We've invested in equipment throughout the province.

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, just for the benefit of the minister, I will table the section of the Auditor General's Report where he criticizes the minister's department for having zero dollars allocated to health equipment and for raiding the emergency fund for just that purpose. It's not the only example. Ernst &amp; Young was commissioned by the department a year ago, a $100,000 report that found $52 million in cost savings in administration at the Department of Health and Wellness. But the department rejected 80 per cent of those savings, $43 million in potential money for front-line care that the department rejected in favour of its own bureaucracy. Today we learned there was another $3 million that the department could save that they've rejected in favour of their own bureaucracy. My question to the minister is, why does he consistently reject cost savings that could actually go into improving health care in the province?</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, it's very confusing listening to his answer. The one thing - and I think I said it earlier - that we have rejected is the way the former government provided health care service here in Nova Scotia. What we've rejected is the way they've invested in Nova Scotia, especially in health care. We have been working extremely hard over the last three years to ensure that we continue to invest in health care services.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, what the minister is confused about is that he is the minister of the department today. It is his government that is responsible for health care now. But perhaps if you had nothing good to say about your own administration, you would have to reach back as far into the past as possible to come up with an answer, that's the problem with this government. Three million dollars a year that could go into health care today, $43 million that could go into health care, according to Ernst &amp; Young, rejected by his department, rejected by that minister. The Auditor General points it out today so I will ask the minister to set it right. Will he now commit to implementing all the projects that Ernst &amp; Young identified and the Auditor General identified and put that money back out of administration and into front-line health care?</p>

If the member opposite had his choice, he would get rid of our volunteer boards across the province and only make decisions out of Halifax. That is not the direction this government is going to take. We are working through merged services to reduce administrative costs in the health care system, so we can redirect that to the front-line health care services, something that the former government didn't do.</p>

All that money and now there are more Nova Scotians unemployed than during the recession. The NDP was not always so fond of such corporate handouts. On October 20, 1999, the now Deputy Premier said, "You should be ashamed, that much money going out to a corporation that can darned well afford to do this on their own, but you want to dole it out to your buddies . . . You should be ashamed of yourself, your Leader should be ashamed, your whole government should be ashamed."

Had we not done that, not only would tuition fees be going down, as compared to the national average, they would have gone up by some 15 to 20 per cent.</p>

He said last week, and he agreed he said it, that he did not advocate for a tuition freeze yet the Party's own Web site, at least until yesterday - maybe they've taken it off now during Question Period - but as late as yesterday, and the time and date are on there, said that this Premier currently supports a tuition freeze.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I would like to advocate, in fact, is for lower tuition for all of our students. In fact what we would like to do is reduce student debt even further. What we would like to do is make sure that as many people as have the capacity and capability to go to university or community college, go. Those are the things that we advocate for, but we're in government. We have to make sure that we have the money to pay for it and that's what we're doing.

Late last month six counsellor-attendants working in addictions and mental health within the Cape Breton district were issued layoff notices effective January 1, 2013.

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. No doubt we're always cautious and concerned whenever there is a reduction of employment for anybody in the province, we recognize that. One thing we did know after coming into government is that we went out and we consulted within the mental health and addictions field, with partners. We produced the first-ever - for our province - Mental Health and Addictions Strategy. No question, with that strategy comes a change of model of care and it's unfortunate that this does affect a small number of health care workers in this province, but I do believe with the change in model of care that the services that will be provided will better meet the needs of those who are seeking services within addictions services.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, as I know the minister is very aware, there is no "one size fits all" treatment when it comes to treating addictions. This is why it is important to have a number of tools available to us when it comes to treating these very devastating and dangerous addictions for families and those who are addicted. It's important to support Talbot House and its model because it works for some people, it's important to have appropriate treatments available when and where they are needed because that works for others. It is important to acknowledge that counselling is a vital part of treating addictions because, again, counselling works in some cases.</p>

With the federal minister's approval of the generic form of OxyContin, it will be only a matter of time before the number of prescriptions rise for the soon-to-be available generic. Earlier this year the Minister of Health and Wellness of the day issued a press release removing OxyContin and OxyNEO as a benefit onto the formulary and listing OxyNEO as an exception status drug for the purpose of prescribing - and I will table this release.</p>

Independent Nova Scotian truckers make a valuable contribution to our economy. They provide cost-effective delivery of services to fix and build our roads. For maintenance, and now with the government's new paving plant, this government is choosing to do trucking internally at a cost of $84.88 per hour, per axle, for a 10.6-ton load, when it could be paying independent truckers $59.67 for a 16-ton load.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, as I've highlighted, it is an inefficient use of equipment. Our independent truckers provide better value for our tax dollar. The trucks this government is using to pave roads, with the NDP road-paving plan are actually designed to plow snow. They have extra heavy-duty frames which limits how much material they can haul when working on paving projects. My question to the minister is, when will the minister end this experiment into road paving and leave this work to the people who can do just as good a job for less cost?</p>

As the member will know, this is the first year that we've engaged in the asphalt paving and, coincidentally, we've started paving in his neck of the woods - up in Cape Breton. We were up there earlier this summer and paved, I believe it was 28 kilometres of road in the Victoria County area.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, the more pavement I get for my constituents, the happier I am, and the less it costs, the more we're all going to get. So this summer this government was once again slow to get tenders out for paving projects. Getting these tenders out earlier in the year allows bidders to optimally plan their construction season and bid on more tenders. More bids would bring us lower-cost paving and that means we would all see more roads paved. Truckers sat around at the start of the summer with no work, they told me that themselves, only to be swamped with work when this government finally got all the tenders out.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, I think I can promise I'll keep bringing it until I actually get an answer. I don't know if any of the ministers have been by the waterfront recently, but much of it resembles a moonscape. It is ugly and dusty and the residents there are sick of looking at the mess. So my question to the Economic and Rural Development and Tourism Minister is, are there any plans to mitigate the moonscape there until such time as development starts, if indeed development is approved?</p>

          <from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, in the face of massive NDP handouts of hundreds of millions of dollars to big corporations, the NDP has refused to commit to extending tax rebates to companies that are here in Nova Scotia and employing people in an industry that traditionally pays an above-average wage. The Digital Media Tax Credit has helped companies in the industry, and in our province, but it expires in a little over a month. My question for the Minister of Finance is, will the Minister of Finance commit to extending this valuable tax credit past January 1, 2013?</p>

          <from>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD</from>
          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, the Digital Media Tax Credit is indeed an important support for what I, and my colleagues here, consider a very important industry that makes a significant contribution to the province. I have said that I am looking at the credit. I understand it has an expiry date and I will have something to say on that in the not-too-distant future.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, my problem is that it is already November 21st and this credit will expire at the end of January, so we are within almost two months of that time. This is an industry, as in every other industry, that requires some planning and some advance time. Companies can't operate with that level of insecurity so that is my biggest concern. I don't hear an answer from the minister. I'm not pleased to hear that we have to wait longer on that.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : We don't have too many filmmakers working in the Department of Finance; we do have accountants. It is a tax credit and the criterion that applies to a tax credit is, in fact, a financial calculation. However, let me say that the current tax credit costs approximately $3 million this year. Since it was introduced more than $10 million have been spent on this tax credit. That is not an insignificant amount of money; it's a significant amount of money. It has provided support to about 130 different productions and, as I said, I will have something to say, quite soon, in terms of the future of the tax credit.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that there are not any film makers on the provincial payroll. The difficulty with this industry is that we are using a definition for digital media that is not the industry standard. A company named Stitch Media was recently here in the province and was hiring people. They've had to leave the province after actually taking the government to court, and winning in court. A ruling that said, and I'll table this, Mr. Speaker : "In an oral decision judge Kevin Coady ruled that the Finance Department's ruling failed to meet the necessary criteria for being justifiable, transparent and intelligable (sic)."</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Over the past few months, the past year I guess, in discussions over Muskrat Falls in this House, in the media, in Newfoundland and Labrador, and in Nova Scotia, there has been considerable conflicting information from various sources. So I think the Premier must understand by now that there is a need and a desire by Nova Scotians to have accurate information about this project. The Premier continues to say that this is a good project and yet has been unable to provide the information to back that up and therefore, it cannot seek all-Party support as a result.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, there have been numerous hurdles even in Newfoundland and Labrador. If I heard the Premier correctly just now, he said the first step is to have it approved in Newfoundland and Labrador. I think we all know that the Premier there has now introduced a Private Member's Bill, which will only allow two hours debate on it there, so I'm sure that will get approved by their government.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course as you would know, Muskrat Falls is supposed to be phase one of that project, with Upper Churchill being the second part of it. We will of course look forward to that complete development taking place. Of course, we understand that after 35 years the projections that we have seen suggest there will still be power that we would be able to take, not only what was initially committed, but we'll be able to take at the New England price, less transmission. It would be the cheapest available power for Nova Scotia and continue to make up part of the portfolio.</p>

I think it begs the question, is our economy really that bad? I guess we need to ask, why do those companies need that kind of money? I was listening to the Minister of Finance speak, and sometimes I write my speeches based on what I hear on the other side - it's a lot easier that way - but the minister mentioned that decisions made by previous governments have left this government dealing with high energy costs.</p>
