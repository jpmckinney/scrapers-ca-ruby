          <from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from>
          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Mr. Speaker, we live in a beautiful province and part of what makes Nova Scotia so special is our natural beauty, our coastlines, our lakes and our woods. The proposed new Community Easements Bill and the amendments to the Conservation Easements Act aim to protect and enhance access to our lands. These changes began as part of an election commitment that was made in 2009 - a commitment to those people across our province from foresters to conservationists who had put aside their sometimes different interests to come together to preserve 170,000 acres of forest land for sale in southwestern Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister and his staff for providing us with an advance copy of the statement. It's my pleasure to respond today to the minister's statement on the Community Easement Bill. I'm a bit surprised that the introduction of a bill requires a statement given the minister will have ample time to debate the bill in the House in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the minister for providing us with a copy of his statement well in advance today. In general, our caucus believes that the Community Easements Bill is a good idea. We are pleased to see that its time has finally come here in Nova Scotia. Legislation of this kind has been used in other jurisdictions for years, and I may note, with success. We have a longstanding model of that success in Nova Scotia with the Conservation Easements Bill. Many parcels of land have been protected by such organizations as the Nova Scotia Nature Trust, and the Nature Conservancy. These lands are ecologically significant and they have been protected voluntarily by landowners who want to see the ecological value of their lands maintained forever. It has allowed Nova Scotians who are landowners to make sure that the tremendous value in their land that they know is well preserved.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I know there's a number of friends who are in the gallery, both sides today and I just want to welcome them. There's one in particular who I want to single out and I just want to warn her that it's her husband who gave me a call earlier today. From my constituency there's Laurie MacKinnon and I wanted to wish her happy birthday today. So if all the folks in the House could wish her a happy birthday, please do that. Laurie is sitting up there, probably turning red right now. (Applause)</p>

The fact of the matter is that there are fewer members of the Public Service now than there were when we came to office. I will table for the member opposite the review of the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board, which says that between 2006-07 and 2011-12, the number of students in that school board has gone down by 2,250, but the number of hours for EAs have gone up by 146. That's more resources in the classroom.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, as all Nova Scotians now know, last night at the eleventh hour - after 172 beds had been closed at Capital Health, 430 surgeries cancelled, 2,000 outpatient appointments wiped out, 530 diagnostic tests put on hold - the government and the workers of Capital Health reached a tentative agreement. Nova Scotians were disappointed that for weeks the Premier allowed all of this to go on, and now they deserve to know how much this agreement is going to cost them.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course, as the member opposite has indicated, there is a tentative agreement - that means that it will have to go to a vote for the union, so at this point, you know, any discussion with respect to the financial impact for the province or, for that matter, the benefits which might accrue to the workers is purely speculation. So there's no need to engage in that at this point.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out, there is no agreement - there is a tentative agreement. We are, of course, very hopeful that the membership of the Capital District Local will adopt the recommendation of their union executive and ratify the agreement, but until that time any discussions with respect to these things is purely speculative. Furthermore, if they accept the agreement, there will be an arbitrator put in place, and the arbitrator would then have to make a decision before the government would be fully apprised of what those costs would be. So there is an appropriate time for the release of information and there is an inappropriate time to do that - we will wait until the appropriate time.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, it's clear that the Leader of the Official Opposition didn't read the material that I just gave him. It points out that despite the fact - for example, in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board - the number of students went down by some 2,250 - the actual supports in the classrooms through EAs actually increased by 146 hours. Those aren't our figures; those are the figures of the school board.</p>

If you look at EAs from 2009 to 2010 in the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board, 2,091 hours; if you look at it presently, now it's 1,996 - by most people that's a decrease. If you look at library full-time equivalents, when he took office they were 39.6, they're at 38.1 - by most people's math, that's a decrease. If you look at the full-time IT support equivalents, when he took power they were 22, now they're at 20 - that's a decrease by anyone's math. I think he's trying to take credit for the former Tory Government.</p>

He understands, I'm sure, that with the large decrease in the population of students in the province that, in fact, we have a system where demand is decreasing. I pointed out to him, and he can try to cherry-pick the last three years, but you cannot deny the inevitability of 2,250 fewer students in a regional school board and an increase of 146 additional EA hours.

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, there is no one denying the fact that our student population has decreased, but what's insulting to teachers, parents and all Nova Scotians is that this government and this Premier have boiled the debate down to fewer students mean we need fewer teachers, it does not take into account that the complexity of the classroom has changed not only over the last decade but substantially over the last number of years. We're asking teachers, we're asking the system, to do more with less. It simply doesn't add up.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, increasing the number of EA hours does put more supports in the classroom, that's exactly what it does. Given, even, that there are 2,250 less students, there are only 10 less teachers, meaning that there is more time for the teachers to give individual attention to the students - that is increasing supports. What the statistics also show is that the student/teacher ratio has actually dropped since 2006-07 by 1.4 students per teacher.</p>

In neighbouring New Brunswick, Justice Minister Bernard LeBlanc, (Interruption) apparently the Minister of Agriculture doesn't want to even listen here, but in neighbouring New Brunswick, Justice Minister Bernard LeBlanc resigned from Cabinet in February 2010 over the improper release of a name in an e-mail. At the time of the resignation Mr. LeBlanc stated, "I want to offer my sincerest apologies to the individual . . . without reservation . . . to the individual and her family for this error."</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, on the very day that the department received the report that he refers to, the minister went to the RCMP, which was the appropriate protocol, fulfilling her responsibility, in, I might add, an excellent fashion. Secondly, the mentions of the executive director in that report refer to an operational review. It is that member and members of his caucus - if anyone is smearing anyone, it is them.</p>

There is no one who cares more about our children than our teachers, and it's because of this - do you know what? I'm not surprised that this minister shows such disdain for our teachers, because her cuts are taking them out of our classroom and that's also shameful. It's unbelievable how this government, who championed education in Opposition, has so changed their tune now that they're in government - $65 million out of our classrooms and we say we're putting kids and learning first? That's a joke. I'm just so ashamed to sit here in this House and hear a minister attack our teaching professionals like she has today.
