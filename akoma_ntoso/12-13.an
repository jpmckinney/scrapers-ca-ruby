          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to rise in my place and talk about a very important issue facing our society, the issue of bullying and cyberbullying. Whether it's in our classrooms, on our streets, or through a text message, the act of intimidation and persecution will not be tolerated, and that is why this government took action and established a Task Force on Bullying and Cyberbullying. With Professor MacKay's leadership, the task force submitted their report and recommendations earlier this session. I would again like to thank Professor MacKay, the task force, and the working group, for the thorough and comprehensive work that they did.</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, we need to encourage discussion among parents and children, not create new barriers that discourage or inhibit open and honest communication. This government's proposed legislation is not a series of one-off bills. This government's legislation will help provide the foundation for the development and implementation of a strong provincial action plan.</p>

          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, I rise in my place today to talk about Raymond Taavel. Last night hundreds attended a vigil for Ray on Gottingen Street here in Halifax. The vigil, in fact, grew so large that police shut down the street. Someone there pointed out that Ray lived the kind of life that brought all these people out last night. His co-worker from the Shambala Sun, Barry Boyce, called him "a compassionate activist, without anger." That is the description of a fine person by anyone's measure.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the Premier for an advance copy of his statement today in celebrating the life of Raymond Taavel. Yesterday the North End Halifax community, and indeed the province, was the unintended host of fear and tragedy. It was also the host of love and hope. Upon learning of the death of Raymond, Nova Scotians were lost in a fog of sorrow and incomprehension. Yet as the day went on, flags and improvised memorials sprung up in windows, on fences, and on rooftops along Gottingen Street. By evening, hundreds of people had showed up to the vigil celebrating Raymond's life, his struggle against discrimination, and his efforts to bring people and communities together. This is how we fight back against violence which ended his life, by coming together through understanding.</p>

I do appreciate that we are taking a few moments out from the proceedings today to talk about what has happened in the City of Halifax over the last two days. It is a sad and tragic time for the family of Raymond Taavel and for all Nova Scotians, and, I would add, a sad and tragic time for all of those who value peace; who value diversity; who value the freedom to express yourself no matter who you are as a Nova Scotian; who value a province where all who are here are free to be themselves, to represent their community, to join in the great cause of building a modern and diverse and exciting and dynamic and progressive Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : I'm pleased today to introduce in the Speaker's Gallery, Dr. John Calder, he's the senior geologist with the Department of Natural Resources. He has just written a new book called Coal Age Galapagos: The Joggins Fossil Cliffs. I'm sure teachers, students and all Nova Scotians will welcome this great book; we had a launch of it earlier in the Veterans Room. With Dr. Calder today is Don James, our executive director of Mineral Resources, and Bruce Nunn from our communications department. I will ask them to rise to receive a warm welcome from everyone.

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in light of the tragedy that happened in our province early morning Tuesday, Nova Scotians are feeling, quite frankly, that the system has failed them - whether it is the justice system or whether it is the mental health system in this province - on how we deal with Nova Scotians. My question through you to the Premier is, how does an individual with a significant history of violence get an unescorted, unsupervised, day pass and release from custody?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of the Official Opposition quite correctly said, it is certainly a horrific set of events that occurred and which we had an opportunity to speak about just earlier. What I can say is this: the process for release is through the Criminal Code Review Board which is a federally-mandated board that complies with the provisions of the Criminal Code. They make a determination with respect to the question of discharge.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#3d2afb09-46bb-45b0-8cdb-90ba97b15ed0">
          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are asking a basic question. When you look at the history of the accused - if you look at, going back as recently as the Fall of 2009 that the accused had been deemed not criminally responsible for his actions and then some eight months later he is being released into the general population on a day pass, I think it's a legitimate question. I know that this process is being reviewed and I want to ask the Premier - in that review are we just looking at what has happened in the hours of Monday and Tuesday of this week or are we actually reviewing the entire case that is associated with the release of this prisoner?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I would make one correction first, although it's a small one - I believe the individual in question was actually on a one-hour pass. What we're going to look at is the whole question of the process: whether or not the provisions are adequate, whether or not they were followed and, as I mentioned, the actual provision of law with respect to release are set out in the Criminal Code and the requirements to which the board must meet therefore are not a matter of our direct jurisdiction.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the Premier's correction; it was a one-hour pass which turned out to be a very much longer period of time. My final question to the Premier is, as we go through this process to try to discover what went so terribly wrong, are you and someone in your government now contacting the federal government to review the process that falls under their jurisdiction in order for this person to have been released into the community?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, to my knowledge, reviews of these provisions are routinely monitored by the federal government. In fact, I believe the provisions that are in place now are not actually that old. In the end, though, it comes down to a question of judgment that is exercised by the board.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Justice. Last April, the minister wrote an opinion piece for public consumption announcing that his department had a new public disclosure policy that will guide the release of information to the general public in the event there was an incident involving the release of a person in the custody of the province - and I will table that opinion piece, which lists the guidelines for such a release.</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : I assume my colleague will understand that I'll not talk about the particular case as that's now before the courts, but what I will talk about is about the policy and the procedure. We announced today that we will be doing a review and having a review. I'm in partnership with the Minister of Health and Wellness, and we are going to have a statement back by 30 days from now to talk about were the policies and procedures followed, and at that point to determine if they were adequate and in what direction we need to go.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : I appreciate the answer and I was in fact attempting to ask only about the policy, and so in supplementary I will ask the minister: According to his own policy - which I have and will table for the benefit of the House - the minister's department will issue a public advisory or a news release where it's believed there may be a danger to public safety, I'd like to ask the minster, what factors does he consider when deciding whether a person is a danger to public safety, and would he consider a release in the case of a person who is found not criminally responsible a potential danger to public safety?</p>

          <from>MR. LANDRY</from>
          <p>MR. LANDRY : I just want to start my answer off by saying that the whole issue around Mr. Taavel's passing is a sad one and our feelings and thoughts go out to the family - and I know some of his friends are here in this House - and to the community at large because it's not just his friends and his families that are affected, this issue has affected the community as a whole.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, according to media reports, the accused murderer of Raymond Taavel had a long history with police, including a number of charges that most Nova Scotians would consider to constitute a danger to public safety. I'd like to ask the minister, under his new policy instituted last April, how many times has the public been notified about an at-large person who has been found not criminally responsible but who is nonetheless at large?</p>

          <from>MR. LANDRY</from>
          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, one of the balancing steps that needs to occur here is when someone moves from a criminal forum to the issue of mental health or health issues. This is an issue of mental health and whether someone is being re-engaged with society in the process. There's a very clear line process that's there. One of the things that we want to do in our review, as I've stated, is examine whether the policies and procedures were followed, and when we get those answers, were they adequate at this time?</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians today are looking for answers. While we cannot expect the government to control random acts of violence, we have to ask how someone who is under the care and custody of the Province of Nova Scotia was allowed out on an unescorted pass with such a violent past in their history. Nova Scotians are asking how Mr. Denny was allowed to leave the East Coast Forensic Hospital in Burnside.</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, there's a very defined process that's followed under the Criminal Code. Once the individual is deemed by the committee that they can have a pass, as I understand the process, the final stage goes to the health care professionals of the institution and is examined. There are many factors, as I'm learning, that go into the decision making, and the level of care that's put into it is quite intense. In this situation, there was a one-hour pass issued. I respect the decision and I respect the processes.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, we're once again left in a situation where the Minister of Justice is reacting to an incident rather than being proactive. All Nova Scotians, and this government in particular, are aware of several incidents where we have seen mistaken releases, unlawful escapes, and administrative errors in our justice system.

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I understand the confusion. This matter is very complex. It is complex because we're not dealing with people in custody; we're dealing with patients in a hospital. Their care falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Wellness when they are patients in the forensic hospital, when they have been found by the board to be not criminally responsible and they, in fact, have had their offences - they have been discharged, with certain conditions.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice made it clear yesterday that while the admittance and discharge of individuals at the East Coast Forensic Hospital fell under the responsibility of the Department of Health and Wellness, while they are at the facility they are under his care and control and his responsibility, so we're going by what the Minister of Justice has told us. The Minister of Justice has indicated that there is a policy for that facility of notifying the public when there are significant incidents, especially in the cases where someone either is wrongfully dismissed, or unlawfully escapes, or is discharged temporarily and does not return. Nova Scotians are rightfully asking today, once an individual who is granted a one-hour pass did not return, why were Nova Scotians not made aware of this?</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I will answer that. In this circumstance here, if I can point out to the member that there are two aspects to the forensics unit, there is one chamber that deals with individuals who are under secure custody. There is the other that's in the process where they are part of the health area that are subject to day passes, to hourly passes, and once they don't return there is a policy in place, which was followed. The police were notified and that's where we're at. At that point we would assess in the future on incidents that go beyond a certain point and if there's any indication that the person presents a threat, it would be addressed at that time. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice, but if the responsibility more falls under the Minister of Health and Wellness, I'm happy if he refers the question. We've been asking some questions about what has been happening and my question is about the release of individuals from the East Coast Forensic unit. We presume that there has to be some period of model behaviour before they are given some kind of a pass to leave the facility and it may be a temporary pass. My question is, what is the process that leads to the release of individuals from the East Coast Forensic Hospital and what steps are taken to monitor their actions after release for the safety of our public, with particular respect to those who have had a history of violent activity?</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : I do thank the honourable member for the question. I do recognize that it is a confusing situation. We have two units over in Burnside. We have the East Coast Forensic psychiatric hospital, and in this hospital we have a unit for people - for example, the accused today is in a unit because the individual has faced new criminal charges and a determination will have to be made with respect to that individual's capacity around this.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, again, I think this will go back to the Minister of Health and Wellness. Nova Scotians, I believe, want a process in place that works to protect both patients and the public. Can the minister advise how many Nova Scotians are now on temporary release and perhaps on some type of longer-term release after a finding of being not criminally responsible for violent activity, so that we might have an understanding of how many people may be out there on leaves who may have had this past violent history?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I don't have actual numbers today. This is a question that I, myself, have asked of the Capital District Health Authority and the head of the forensic unit. The response that I've received is that in some ways this changes almost day by day; people can be remanded to the facility through the courts on a daily basis. In addition to that, the review board, the Criminal Review Board, may meet and have a disposition with respect to an individual. That means that the person is transferred from one unit to another. There may be a number of people who are out right now on passes, having been successfully integrated over a gradual process into the community.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I believe that those found not criminally responsible for crimes committed must become the responsibility of the system that releases them from that responsibility. Not so long ago, we had a loss of life, in my own constituency, of a gentleman at the hands of an individual with a history of mental illness and violent behaviour - I say "mental illness" but I'm always careful to say that because I know there are many people who suffer from mental illness who would never do anything like this. But this particular individual was obviously troubled, he had a checkered past, run-ins with the law and violent behaviour.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health and Wellness has confirmed that at least individuals who had been granted passes on Monday evening failed to return to the East Coast Forensic Hospital once their pass had expired. The media is reporting a third individual, which we will wait for the minister to confirm whether that is the case or not.

SAMSON : Well, Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians will be asking the question of how prevalent this is and what steps are in place, especially now when we're talking about reviewing protocols.

          <p>MR. SAMSON : I'm sure the minister knows that is information we'll all be hoping to receive and that it will be part of the review as well. The question here is how a decision is made on whether a pass is escorted or whether it is unescorted, and the question here is with an individual with such a violent past, why there was not some form of an escort. I'm wondering if the minister could advise us whether she has any data as to how many escorted passes are issued versus unescorted passes, and at the same time who exactly would escort an individual if it's determined to be an escorted pass?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Thank you very much for the question. The information I have is certainly that it is routine for patients who are in the forensic hospital who have been discharged in terms of the reintegration back into the community, that they receive passes. There is a variety of passes into the community that's available to them. The one-hour pass is the minimum kind of pass, unescorted, but there are, as well, escorted passes that occur. For an individual to go by themselves, one hour is the minimum and they can be much longer than that. They can be an overnight, they could be a weekend, they could be for a holiday - you know a long weekend or whatever, depending on the clinical assessment, the judgment of the clinicians that are involved in treating those patients.</p>

The concern that we have, though, is that media has been reporting that there were three clients, so maybe what I'll ask the minister to provide, at her earliest convenience - it's not something that I think she can provide to us right now - but maybe a cumulative of hours of all patients on unescorted passes, with a history of violence, who maybe have been absent beyond the time permitted to be out.</p>

As he would understand, and as we have said before in this House, this is not an easy matter to deal with.

Whether it be the changes to the IWK ACT and Compass programs or an announced closure of a Capital District 28-day residential treatment for adults with addictions. All of these changes have occurred in a vacuum without a strategy to guide them.

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, in addition to the minister's obvious disregard, she shows us time and time again that she is simply not up to her job. Yesterday Father Abbass released a statement in which he expressed his disappointment with the matter of the review conducted by the Department of Community Services, and I will table that as well. The parents of East Preston Day Care expressed their disappointment and their outrage with the department's arrogance surrounding the protection of an alleged pedophile.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking, and each and every day that passes produces disruption in health care facilities within the Capital District and throughout Nova Scotia. Patients are being transferred now, today, not one week from today. Patients who have been waiting for surgery and thought they would get it next week are being told they will have to wait even longer and those who thought they were next will also wait longer. Given this government's supposed concern about wait times, what, if any, proactive measures has the Premier taken to get both parties back to the collective bargaining table?</p>

I want to assure him that we are making every effort possible to get the parties back to the table. This is a difficult part in the bargaining process, difficult for everyone involved.

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, here's the reality. According to the Capital District no talks have been scheduled this week. A significant amount of time is being spent on the part of Capital District trying to rearrange services so fewer patients are and will be served, when wait times are telling us we need to be doing the exact opposite. Given that the government is the ultimate employer, why has the Premier been sitting on the sidelines when our health care system throughout Nova Scotia is experiencing such upheaval?</p>

They must play a leadership role and acknowledge that at the end of the day they are the employer, given that the best option for patients is to see this government negotiating now, not one week from now, and the best deal for taxpayers can best be settled at the bargaining table through robust collective bargaining and negotiations between the employees and the employer.

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Thank you Mr. Speaker. In May of 2011, a year ago almost, Dr. Wayne MacKay was asked to lead a task force on cyberbullying. This was in response to an ongoing problem facing our youth. One of the key recommendations in that report was to appoint an anti-bullying coordinator who would oversee the implementation of the actions by the government in response to the report. The coordinator was to be in place as soon as possible, and no later than the end of 2011-12 school year.</p>

It will be an anti-bullying coordinator that we have at the Department of Education. There will be a competition for this job and the department is in the stage of having what criteria we would like to have in place. We're looking for a person who not only has the skills, also the passion to bring to this job.

Once again the minister was unable to identify a timeline, going to her favourite response: "Soon, very soon." Unfortunately we've seen the sad results from bullying, and yet the minister can do nothing better for the timeline than soon, very soon. So my question to the minister is, will she share with members of this House her timeline for implementation?</p>

We have started that work; we have laid down the foundation; we're moving forward within the department - and actually I would like to add not just within the department but many departments are involved in looking at ways that we can remedy the situation. But it will be the anti-bullying coordinator's job to work with our stakeholders and our partners as we develop a plan, as we move forward. We want to make sure that the action we put in place is going to be action that actually benefits our students.</p>

The minister talks about limited resources and setting priorities. The minister, Mr. Speaker, has a choice of where to spend that half a million dollars - it could be to purchase lunch bags or trinkets for four-year-olds, or it could be to begin the implementation of recommendations designed to protect our students from bullying, and to make our schools safe.

As a public school system, there are many components of our education program that need to be taken care of. I would like to stand on record that it is not fair to name a resource that's going in the hands of our youngest students, an investment in the hands of our youngest students, as a "lunch bag." These are resources coming from the work with the early intervention teachers in our province, and recognizing these as resources that enable families to engage in literacy activities.</p>

So people are very close to their land and they don't want to see it destroyed by carpetbaggers coming in from other places to make a quick buck who leave the mess for future generations to clean up.

Our future is entirely dependent on how we treat our education system, and this government's decisions are directly responsible for increased costs to education in the province. The province's funding cuts to universities have caused a $6.9 million shortfall - a shortfall being paid for by students and their families at Dalhousie University. We know that Primary to Grade 12 education is not a priority for this government, and now $75 million in post-secondary cuts shows that PSE is not a priority for this government either.</p>

We recognize that many people are concerned, particularly patients in the system and their families, and we would encourage the parties to get back to the table and work their differences out.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her answer, but there are 9,000 people already on the surgery wait list, and apparently 700 surgeries will have to be cancelled each day of the strike and the system, itself, can't make up for those cancellations without pushing them further and further out. My question to the minister is, what is her plan, outside of just calling on those parties to get back together, what is she going to do to ensure that those parties get back together?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, it is the case that the Capital District has a plan that they are in the stages of putting into place. It's a plan that is prudent to have and is necessary to have as we're in a very critical point in the collective bargaining process. Again, I really am not going to insert myself into a process where I encourage the parties to get back to the table and work their differences out.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of lives in some cases, depending on the surgeries that those individuals might require. We all know that health care workers are very well-represented at the table and the health authority is well-represented at the table, but the one that, of course, is sort of left out in that equation is the public. I think it's the minister's responsibility to protect the public. My question to the minister is, are all options truly on the table for this minister, including back to work legislation, as was suggested in today's ChronicleHerald editorial, which was called "Health Bargaining - Public comes first," or is she willing to see a strike go on for days or even weeks before the government takes action?</p>

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, it's not only our universities that are facing increased costs as a result of this government's decisions. The Nova Scotia Community College has laid off eight college prep coordinators as a result of a $5.37 million budget shortfall, as a result of this government's cuts. These coordinators work in junior high schools to encourage students to stay in school, to know their options upon high school graduation, and provide information to students for career planning. This initiative prepares junior and senior high school students for admissions to programs at NSCC's 13 campuses. My question for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education is, that the college prep program has been eliminated, who is going to do this vitally important work in our schools?</p>

          <p>HON. MARILYN MORE : Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by commending the Nova Scotia Community College for taking a very thorough and responsible view in terms of their budget. I'm sure everybody in this Chamber agrees that it's an excellent training institution and it's one whose work and contribution to this province is very much appreciated by all Parties and by all citizens. Certainly, I think it has probably been 10 or 12 years since it evolved from the former vocational school system and it has been doing a tremendous job.</p>

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, the minister might appreciate the cuts that NSCC is being forced to make, but I assure the minister that parents and students don't appreciate how this government is treating education systems in this province. Not only will we not have those incredibly important prep coordinators in our schools anymore, the college will also introduce a $100 student fee to cover things like convocations and ID cards. Students and their families are finding it hard to cover the rising costs of education and still the minister shows no support for core funding to our institutions.</p>

At the same time we realize that new investments need to be made and, certainly, we have made an additional investment in the community college that protects the trades and is helping to get Nova Scotians prepared for the economic opportunities that are on our horizon.</p>

Back in 2010, legislation was passed in this House to require motorists to slow down when passing emergency vehicles stopped on the side of the road - a good bill. However, in order for the law to be effective, Nova Scotians need to know this legalisation is in place. My question to the minister is, what has the department done to inform Nova Scotia's drivers of this new law?</p>

Shortly after this law was enacted, The ChronicleHerald reported that few vehicles were slowing down to 60 kilometres an hour and obeying the law when passing an emergency vehicle stopped on the side of the road. At the time, only 10 per cent of the more than 150 vehicles that passed RCMP cruisers slowed down to the required speed limit.</p>

          <p>MS. MICHELE RAYMOND : Madam Speaker, it's a real pleasure to rise today to speak on Opposition business, which is Bill No. 29, the Child Protection Intervention Act. I have to say that I absolutely commend and understand the intent of this bill. All of us feel that it is paramount to protect children from all sorts of harms - not only from the harms which may be deliberately inflicted, but from the varieties of harm which can occur throughout the world.</p>

When I look at this bill and I hear what is being talked about in this House today, I hear the breach in confidentiality. I understand that part of the bill, but we have to think as well of the cost of a child suffering abuse that is immeasurable.</p>

I'm very happy to rise and speak to the issue of gasoline regulation because, once again, we see some members of this House have a selective memory when it comes to the regulations. Perhaps some of them were not paying attention during the summer of 2004 and 2005 - and since that may be the case I think a little history might be enlightening.</p>
