          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I've been a proud New Democrat for more than 30 years, but never prouder than I am now as I reflect on all that our government is doing to make life better for Nova Scotian families. Nova Scotia's first NDP Government came to power in 2009, in what has turned out to be the worst global recession in living memory.</p>

          <from>MS. WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. WHALEN : Every province in Canada is struggling under the same global forces, but the NDP Government has had the absolute worst record at dealing with them; that is not leadership. While this government says they have improved the productivity of 300 companies, helped Nova Scotians learn new skills and helped Nova Scotian companies compete globally, these efforts have yet to bear fruit. We have more people unemployed now than during the recession. Retail sales are struggling and our exports our lagging.</p>

          <from>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I heard the minister talk about the fact that we have gone through the worst global recession in living memory and there is no question about that, but this has been a time when we have needed leadership in government and we've had none. The government complains that they don't have as much in offshore royalty revenues as they used to have but isn't it the responsibility of the government to be mature and to make decisions? Nova Scotia businesses have to make those decisions, they can't run deficits, but instead this government has chosen to run deficits.</p>

          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it was recently reported that the government has outsourced part of its tendering process to Deloitte. Furthermore the report pointed to a decade-long alliance with IBM, the same company this government has recently outsourced SAP services to. My question to the Premier is, will the Premier table the complete details of the procurement outsourcing and the extent to which this work will be performed by the private sector?</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I concur with the Premier, I think that the matter is not a matter about outsourcing at all. However, I will look into this matter further for the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I take from that they will also table the complete details associated with this. Previously all tenders offered and RFPs were posted on the Government Web site where anyone could examine the full tender. Just yesterday in this House the Premier said, ". . .you have full transparency on this side of the government." The report suggests that Deloitte will work as the gatekeeper and place additional roadblocks before Nova Scotians who are trying to view the full government tenders. At best, the new requirements will cause delays, at worst, these changes could block access. My question to the Premier is, if this government is going to offer full transparency, why is the government placing additional roadblocks between Nova Scotians and government information?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that's not the case. In fact, as I understand it, I remember seeing an article which I think may be the source of the information that was received by the Leader of the Opposition. There was an article in The Coast which misunderstood the entire idea. The way it works is that there are a number of different pieces of IT work that gets done by a number of different departments and they all tender for them individually, which is a very inefficient system. The government can save more money by having one tendering process, which agreeably could be run by anybody, but I think in this case they may be right that it's being run through Deloitte. This is a matter for them in order to actually be able to process and make sure that the province gets the best prices, as I understand it. Again, the Minister of Finance has already said that she will supply any additional information in that regard, but I think that may be an explanation for the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday Emera said that they're not waiting for the approval of the URB before going ahead with their $1.5 billion subsea cable, every dollar of which will be paid through our power bills over the life of this project.

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, first of all, in the preamble to the question, there was one extreme factual inaccuracy, which is that the project costs will go into the rate base for Nova Scotians. Nothing will go into the rate base of Nova Scotians unless it is approved by the Utility and Review Board, period. That is the important thing for them to know, because the commitment is to the lowest and fairest rates for the people of Nova Scotia. If he was actually at the event where I talked about this, I said that I believe that this will be the case.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I happen to have with me the Premier's own regulations, the Maritime Link Cost Recovery Process Regulations, which say that the URB must approve the Maritime Link project as long as it's consistent with the Premier's own electricity plan - which, obviously, they will be forced to do. The word "must" also appeared in the Newfoundland and Labrador Legislature yesterday, where in Question Period the Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador said that the word "must" is used in the Nova Scotia regulations so they must approve the project if it's the lowest-cost project.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we're not over anything. The initial estimate was simply that. It was not a project cost. It was nothing that was submitted to the Utility and Review Board. It was essentially a high-level estimate, and it's exactly why it is that we wouldn't proceed on that basis. It's exactly why you do an in-depth analysis of the project that includes the pricing of all the different component parts of the project, and that includes the engineering that is required.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier should read his own regulations because the regulations also say that cost is not the only thing that the Utility and Review Board can make its determination on - they can look at many other factors, and so Nova Scotians don't know that they'll get the lowest cost option.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we reminded the Premier of the very first bill that he brought to this House in Opposition, which required that corporate giveaways be audited by the Auditor General. The Premier insisted, in his answer yesterday, that his own record of almost $600 million in corporate giveaways didn't require a value-for-money audit because they were on commercial terms, they were commercial loans. Well, try walking into a bank for a car loan and telling them you have no intention of paying it back and you'll quickly find out the difference between a commercial loan and the actions of the Premier.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Yes Mr. Speaker, that's the magical bank because I'm pretty sure that no matter how good they thought that deal was, they would still ask that their money be paid back during the term of the loan. That's why he is the Premier of Nova Scotia and not the President of the Bank of Nova Scotia, because that bank would be in very big trouble today, if he ran it the way that he just spoke of now.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know that the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party himself used to be a banker, even though he spends much of his time attacking them. I can tell you this, when any company receives security that is 10 times in excess - I've seen a lot of commercial transactions like this - that are 10 times what the value of the loan is, they would always prefer to have that security over the repayment of the loan. Always, under every circumstance.</p>

I can tell you, like every other bank, like every credit union, no matter how great that is, they will still require that loan be paid back on commercial terms. That is the difference between the way credit unions are run and the way the Premier is running the Province of Nova Scotia today.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, all of those people who he has just talked about will be much better off when we receive $2.8 billion in additional tax revenue that can then be used to go into health care, support for seniors, support for those who are on Income Assistance, that can go to support vulnerable people in this province. That is the test for any commercial transaction, which is what is the upside? The upside for Nova Scotians is some $2.5 billion over and above the investment that's being made in the yard, not to mention all the jobs and all of the spin-off activities in the economy.

The co-operative council stated at the time that they will have hundreds of vacant positions to be filled and that the Target 100 program would attempt to train and fill those positions through Community Services' recipients. Can the minister tell the House today how many individuals in receipt of income assistance have enjoyed success with the Target 100 initiative?</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, the Target 100 program is a very good program with the Co-operative Council. I don't have the exact numbers today but I can provide those to the honourable member. I do know that it has been successful, in taking people from income assistance and actually putting them in higher level, paid jobs. The level of the jobs, equal jobs, that are like management positions. It's been very successful in that manner but I will get the numbers for the honourable member. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, December 3, 2012 was celebrated as the 18th International Day of Persons with Disabilities. It was certainly a fitting moment to reflect on the situation of disabled Nova Scotians. Of the many barriers faced by Nova Scotians with disabilities, none is more urgent than the overt job discrimination. Physical barriers, outdated attitudes and failure to provide reasonable accommodations along with disincentives fostered by misguided government programs, figure heavily in the poor outlook for disabled job seekers.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Thank you for the question. Certainly we do that. We do not discriminate between the abled or the disabled community, in terms of those who are on Income Assistance and trying to help them seek employment. We provide many different services for those who have a disability. Actually this week I had the opportunity to speak at a symposium that focused on and awarded employers who are hiring people with disabilities. It was a very emotional and rewarding evening to see those companies throughout all Nova Scotia who are actually seeing the significance and importance of hiring somebody with a disability and all the benefits that they receive from hiring those individuals.

In the winter of 2010, a complaint was filed with the Nova Scotia SPCA, regarding a dog that was permanently chained at a Cape Breton construction site. The Nova Scotia SPCA did investigate but later stated nothing could be done under the Animal Protection Act. A few days after the Nova Scotia SPCA's visit, the dog was found frozen to death at the end of its chain. I will table the story for the minister's ease of reference. Could the minister please outline what he has done to close the gaps in the Animal Protection Act so authorities can adequately and humanely address complaints, like the one that occurred in Cape Breton two years ago?</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, for the information of the member and for all members, the changes in the Act have been significant. As a matter of fact, the member may be aware that the investigative powers of the SPCA have been strengthened and actually the Department of Agriculture had taken over investigations regarding livestock and companion animals that stayed with the SPCA. So the questions for action really are around identification of distress in the animal and that's really all that the SPCA needs in order to act.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I want the member to be aware that we have a fairly open dialogue with the SPCA; as a matter of fact I met with them last week. This has not been an issue that has been raised by the SPCA. The issue that the member raises is more around whether tethering, I think, is appropriate or not. The fact that an animal may be tethered does not necessarily mean the animal is in distress as long as other measures are taken care of as far as shelter, food, water and so on, but the actual tethering in and of itself doesn't necessarily indicate distress for the animal, but in some circumstances it may be associated with that.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, out of respect to the member opposite, I know he is very closely tied to this issue and his personal connection to MS. What the minister said at the time was completely correct: all jurisdictions across Canada have agreed to support national clinical trials of the liberation treatment, in Canada. We have agreed and the process that is in place to choose where these clinical trials are was done independently and the Province of Nova Scotia, we don't know and as minister and as government, don't know who applied to gain access to those clinical trials. It's part of the assessment, as the trials fold out across the country.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, three years ago last month, the Brain Injury Association made a presentation before our Community Services committee. During the presentation, they pointed out that while we have an excellent acute care system, which provides exceptional care at the time of incident and during rehabilitation, the system of supports for patients and their families, once families return home, is lacking. According to a CBC News story dated September 22, 2012, three years later with a headline which read, "Long-term brain injury care lacking, say advocates", and I will table that.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, that's why as coming into government we recognized the importance of providing home support, and providing shelter for individuals. We've continued over the last number of years to work with partners throughout the province to ensure that people have access to the kind of care they need. That's why currently we invested this year an additional $22 million for home care support which touches a wide variety of illness. Most of the users within the home care system are elderly but, of course, those individuals in Nova Scotia who have received a brain injury can gain access to those programs that we offer throughout Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, this is relating to the Continuing Care Strategy. The strategy did state that starting in year four government would respond to acquired brain injury needs - we are now in year seven. Given that very little has happened since the Brain Injury Association appeared before the Community Services Committee three years ago, given the CBC coverage which featured families and advocates still calling for action - and I will table those articles - could the minister please provide some indication as to when the needs of brain injured survivors and their families will start to be addressed?</p>

We have worked together over the last number of years to try to break down the silos that have been built within the government system. For many, many years the departments worked on their own in these silos and that's something that we knew we had to change over the last number of years. So I'm working with the minister and the Department of Community Services.

          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health and Wellness has said that the request for a proposal submitted by Talbot House would be evaluated before the end of the year. Now, we all know that Talbot House was the low bidder to operate a recovery house and that for more than 50 years has provided effective care to men suffering from addictions. It was the philosophy of Talbot House that the government has been at odds with, but without the facility Cape Breton will once again have no recovery house.</p>

But we recognize addiction services in Cape Breton are extremely important. That's why we've seen the change in the model of care that is being delivered by the Cape Breton District Health Authority to address addiction services there, and I can tell the member that the evaluation is going on now. I can say that, hopefully, I'll make an announcement really soon in the new year - within a few weeks after the new year has started.</p>

We are, no question, moving and changing the model of care of addiction services within Nova Scotia to best meet the needs of Nova Scotians who have addictions.

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, tonight we talked about St. Anne's and we talked about long-term care in this one. The wait list for long-term care is the highest it has been, ever, in Nova Scotia. It is growing because the government has taken zero action to address the needs of seniors who can no longer live in their own home. This is throwing home care at something that actually makes their situations unsafe. The waitlist grew to 2,228 seniors in September. That is more than 2,000 families, who have been assessed by the Department of Health and Wellness, as needing more than homecare.</p>

In May of 2008, I remember the NDP putting out this ad and I can't show it because it will be claimed as a prop, but it's called Stop the Waiting and it was about that very issue of, apparently, a long-term care facility not being built, at least near the member's constituency, which, as a matter of fact, the footings were in, things were cleared and the construction was going on, that's how much he was paying attention to the community that he represents.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm glad my colleagues are paying attention because I know the Minister of Aquaculture and Fisheries whispered in my ear about Bay Side Home. That was announced four or five - who knows how many times by the former government, but who built it? It was the NDP Government who built that, it was the NDP Government who opened that home. It was the NDP Government who opened the home in Sackville, and it was the NDP Government who opened the homes across Nova Scotia. The former government waited far too long to get this process started and as we see, they were just focused on one thing. They weren't recognizing that we needed to provide services - not only long-term care services, but we needed to ensure that they have home care and access to home care, something they ignored for far too long.</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : We believe that it is important that all projects get proper scrutiny and that the public monies are always well spent. I am not sure that the way to go about it is to insist through legislation that we hire consultants to do that every time. The costs of consultants are pretty significant.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Madam Speaker, I know we just have a couple of minutes here to go through this but I do want to focus some of my preliminary remarks on what the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville commented on. (Interruptions) I know he spoke about the hospital in Truro, which I see when I'm driving by on the highway, and I guess the question that comes to my mind is, is he also condemning the community because I know the community had a lot to do with that hospital. They had a lot of input in that hospital, and I guess it makes me wonder what the member for Truro-Bible Hill would have to say, because I don't know if she was at the opening.</p>

So I think the member should be careful about condemning, on that matter, because he may inadvertently condemn people of that community as well, and it's true. (Interruptions) It's true.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Right, okay, so she didn't want it to be $80 million over budget. So the government side wanted the hospital, they just didn't want it to be $80 million over budget. That is exactly what we are doing on this side, we are asking those exact questions; that's the point of this. That's why it's so rich. We are asking questions on behalf of taxpayers - $80 million over budget. Well, DSME Trenton was $60 million that we have gotten nothing for. We haven't produced the 500 jobs that were promised. Where is it going next - $60 million - $1 million per job?</p>
