          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank the minister's office for providing our office with the ministerial statement in advance. While the minister outlines various initiatives for seniors in her statement, she fails to point out several key points. While it is important to invest in social programs and keeping people in their communities, it's also important to ensure that seniors can simply make ends meet.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to rise in the House to recognize the appointment of the first board for Arts Nova Scotia. Artistic and cultural activities add to the quality of life enjoyed by Nova Scotians in communities throughout Nova Scotia. But not only do artists enrich our public life with their creativity and their excellence, they also create jobs and economic opportunities in the process.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I too would like to briefly respond to the ministerial statement on behalf of the PC caucus. I am well aware of the importance of active support by government of the artistic community. Whether it's the performing arts, the visual arts, or cultural arts, they all deserve the active encouragement of their government and, indeed, of all members of this House of Assembly. The arts community is definitely a big part of building a modern, dynamic, creative, diverse society here in the capital of Halifax and throughout all of Nova Scotia.</p>

People are struggling, businesses are closing, and the NDP Government has passed the buck to the Utility and Review Board. The government's lack of action is forcing Nova Scotians to decide between keeping the heat on or buying food for the families and the government is clearly out of touch with the priorities of Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the reason why power rates are going up is because the fuel that is used to create power in this province is fossil fuel and that has increased by some 75 per cent over the last seven years &#x2013; more than a 10 per cent a year increase &#x2013; and the reason for that is because past governments did not make it a priority to get off of fossil fuels.

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier is fond of saying his government took the provincial portion of the HST off power bills. However, he's not fond about discussing the new NDP electricity tax, a tax he opposed while in Opposition. This government's demand-side management fees are costing Nova Scotians more than $40 million a year. This government is directly responsible for increased power costs at $40 million.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what he is talking about is the demand-side management charge, which is returned to consumers through programming. What is the truth, though, is this: that the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia campaigned against taking the HST off home electricity. They put it on in the first place and they voted against taking it off. If they were in power today, power prices would be 10 per cent higher.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier campaigned against the demand-side management tax, which he quickly put on. On June 9, a letter to the Utility and Review Board, written by the NDP Government about this electricity tax: " . . . places the burden of DSM-related improvements too heavily on residential users and other rates classes." Further down in the letter from the Premier, " . . . this surcharge on their power bills at this juncture would add unneeded and counter-productive costs to residential and business users." I want to remind this House and all Nova Scotians that since he's become Premier, power rates have gone up over 20 per cent.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. This week the Public Utilities Board of Newfoundland reported that they could not conclude that the Lower Churchill hydro project was the best option for Newfoundland and Labrador. In fact, they said they could not determine whether it was the most affordable power source for Newfoundlanders at all. In Nova Scotia our Premier refuses to do a review of the same project because he has already made up his mind.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, there have been numerous studies that have come out that have shown that this, in fact, is the lowest-cost option for power. It is only the Progressive Conservatives who could choose to gamble on future power rates instead of getting 35 years of power at a fixed rate.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, apparently the Premier feels it is somebody else's responsibility to decide whether this project is in the best interest of Nova Scotia or not. That is a shame because that is the job that the Premier was elected to determine. The fact of the matter is the Premier is fine with this project because someone else is going to end up paying the bills for it, and that someone else is the people of Nova Scotia who will pay the bills for this project. The Premier doesn't even know how much it's going to cost them.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the reason why power rates are where they are today is because the Progressive Conservative Government, over many years, refused to deal with the fact that we had a utility that was completely tied, chained really, to the fossil fuel market, to the international fossil fuel market. That's the problem we had, 10 per cent raises year after year; a 75 per cent increase in fuel costs over seven years - that was the mistake they made that we don't intend to repeat.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Parents are concerned about their children's education. Over the past two years the NDP Government has slashed funding and downloaded costs to school boards. As a result, supports are being lost, teachers are being cut and students are losing their educational assistants. We know that positions have been added to the senior administration of the Department of Education. To be specific, on February 21st a new position was created, an associate deputy minister. My question to the Premier is, why is the Premier increasing senior administration at the department level while cutting funding to the classrooms and eliminating supports for students who need them?</p>

Then, if we take out administrators from that mix, just to make sure that everyone understands that the 12.9 includes our music teachers and physical education supervisors and our administrators, take the administrators out of that, our ratio is 14.7.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I'd be glad to clear up the minister's confusion. It appears she just doesn't get it but Nova Scotians do get it. In response to an article by the minister in the Kings County Register saying that the student-teacher ratio was 12.9 to 1, a letter to the editor stated otherwise and I will table this: "This number may look good on paper. However, it is not the reality of classrooms in the Annapolis Valley region, or much [sic] the province, for that matter. A more realistic average ratio, if you investigate actual classrooms, is closer to 25 to 1."</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, I will repeat, the ratio for teachers and for staff for the province is 12.9. That is a ratio. That is the same kind of ratio that has been used historically and very clearly that is a ratio. Class size, however, is different, which I just explained; when you take out your administrators the ratio changes. The average class size in the province ranged from 21 for the elementary and 24.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I want to be specific about the article that I just tabled. In the Kings County schools there are plenty of examples where the minister's ratio does not ring true. For example, from Primary to Grade 1, 27 to 1; in Grade 5, 30 to 1; in Grade 9 science, 36 to 1; in Grade 9 music, 54 to 1. (Interruptions) I'm sure that the minister would be welcome in that Kings County school.</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : The ratio is 12.9 to 1 and I will repeat a little lesson that I just gave the House; ratio is different than class size. I would say that across the province you are going to find different groupings in class size but based on averages, our class sizes are better than they have been in a generation.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday's budget was yet another disappointment when it comes to addressing the challenges Nova Scotians experience from their health care system. DHAs who are responsible for delivering frontline patient care have been faced with their second consecutive year of budget pressures from this NDP Government and yet somehow are expected to do more with less. Given that the NDP was critical of health care wait times when they were running for election in 2009, could the Premier please explain why his government has delivered yet another budget that does precious little to address Nova Scotia's number one health care priority, wait times?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as the member opposite knows, as the Leader of the Official Opposition knows, we have now moved the administrative costs in health care from being among the highest in the country to below the national average; we've been able to take those costs out of the system. We have participated with the DHAs in merger agreements to ensure that the most cost-effective way of using the money in those district health authorities is used. When we make those savings, we roll them into patient care and that's why we're having success in improving our wait times.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, what I know is he's closing emergency rooms across Nova Scotia and he's investing in senior administration staff for the Minister of Health and Wellness. The average wait time for a diagnostic mammogram at the QE II Hospital is now 97 days, in 2008, the same wait time was 70 days. The wait for lifesaving radiation therapy treatment for cancer patients in the Capital District is 36 days. In May 2008, the wait time in the Capital District was 14 days. Our wait times are going in the wrong direction. My question to the Premier is, can the Premier explain how wait times for these procedures are going to improve?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, first of all I would just like to correct what the Leader of the Official Opposition said. In fact, what is happening is we are keeping emergency rooms open right across the province, 24/7; that is what Better Care Sooner is achieving. It is achieving it through the collaborative emergency centres, a success that is going to be copied in other provinces. I would ask the Minister of Health and Wellness to address the specific questions with respect to wait times.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I want all members to know that this government has made two very significant investments in the millions of dollars, both at the Cape Breton District Health Authority and at the Capital District Health Authority to expand radiation therapy. Construction is underway to accommodate bunkers for new equipment that is required to ensure that we meet the radiation treatment standards for cancer care across Nova Scotia. It is a significant investment, the patients and staff in those programs are very pleased for that investment. It will keep our wait times within the benchmarks that have been established nationally.</p>

Ironically, the Premier talks about emergency rooms, I can tell you there are many communities across this province that understand and know that this government has been closing emergency rooms. He speaks of the Collaborative Emergency Centres; that's a new wait time for this government. They've announced five, and three communities are still waiting for the opening of those centres.</p>

We're doing that, it's being done in a crystal clear fashion, a plan to address them right across the province.

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, nearly six months ago, actually, before we even started the Fall session of the Legislature, the Minister of Health and Wellness told the DHAs to cut 3 per cent from their budgets. According to the media release, the minister wanted more time for planning to allow for the best possible decisions. The reality, however, is that DHAs will be making cuts in order to adhere to the edict from this NDP Government. Given the increased planning time provided, why will members of the House be debating budget cuts without the benefit of the details contained in DHA business plans? My question is for the minister.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as members of this House know, it is under this government that my department has brought in the approval of business plans in the DHAs much earlier than has ever occurred in the past; in fact, at the beginning of the fiscal year. We will be doing that again this year. We've worked very closely with the DHAs and I want to take an opportunity here publicly to thank the DHAs for the hard work that they have done. It is a challenge in our province with an aging population, a population that suffers from high rates of chronic disease to control our health care costs and we are probably the province in the country that is leading the way with respect to having done so. It has been done through the very hard work and dedication of the men and women who work in the DHAs across our province.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, South West Health has seen a budget decrease of close to $1 million over last year's estimate. Pictou DHA is facing a $1.4 million cut and GASHA will be asked to cut $1.3 million from their 2011-12 forecasted expenditure. These are the examples on paper. All DHAs have been asked to do much more with less and yet we are not able to scrutinize the details. Given the minister stated in a news release on October 14th - I'll table that document - that the plan for approval would be submitted before the Spring budget. Will the minister confirm that she and/or her department are aware of DHA budget cut details as a result of approving the business plans?</p>

Last year in the Annapolis Valley, the Berwick clinic slashed its hours to save money in a budget freeze - zero dollars saved. That impacts patient care and puts pressure on the Valley Regional Hospital ER. Other DHAs implemented or increased user fees to deal with health issues at a time when life is less and less affordable for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. TREVOR ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, my question today is for the Minister of Community Services. The community of Dartmouth North is made up predominantly of 60 per cent multi-unit dwellings, and in recent conversations with private landlords our discussions centred around increases in power rates and upcoming increases in water rates, thus resulting in increases in rental costs. One of the conversations also centred around the fact that a number of landlords are more apt to not want to rent to individuals who are on income assistance because they simply don't have enough funding.</p>

          <p>HON. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : Thank you to the member for the question. I have referenced this in the past, and I know it's quite difficult in understanding the shelter rates, but history has shown, unfortunately, that when those shelter rates go up the rent tends to automatically go up. The landlords know that there's an increase. So what we've been doing within our department is offering many different programs that people could access which would increase their income level, and we've done a very good job of that over the last several years in government. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, Poverty Reduction Tax Credits and Affordable Living Tax Credits are only good if you can wait every four months for funding. Nova Scotians are hungry now. Nova Scotians have to pay power bills now, and every month they have to pay rent. Interestingly enough, you don't qualify for those tax credits if you're actually homeless.</p>

          <p>MS. PETERSON-RAFUSE : Mr. Speaker, as I just mentioned, we have offered multiple-type programs that people can access. Now, for example, if you took a single parent with two children, because of the increases in the Affordable Living Tax Credit, the Poverty Reduction Credit, the increase in the Child Benefit that has continually risen, and also the increase on the monthly amount for income assistance, which is $9 this time, it was $15 last year, way more than previous governments - they were doing them at $3 or $4 a year. So that's substantially a lot more, but take for example that single parent, they would have now, after three years, $2,300 annually more in their pockets under this government than they did under the previous government.</p>

          <p>MR. ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, the real issue is that we're seeing more youth who are at risk of being homeless, or who are actually homeless. We're seeing more individuals - men and women - who are struggling, and at the shelter allowances now they simply cannot pay their rent. The majority of these Nova Scotians who rely on the minister's funding have to pay upwards of 60 per cent for their shelter out of their income. That is unacceptable, and this does not make sense when we're asking many of these individuals to deal with their addiction issues and mental health issues and overall well-being and health.</p>

The attachment to the letter sent to the Mental Health Coalition in 2009 goes on to state that the NDP, if forming government, would work to expand both day treatment and in-patient services for adolescents.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Education told the House she was looking forward to April 20th, the day she will receive the priorities of school boards. She said that's when decisions will be made. It seems to me that decisions have already been made and the minister made the decision without any opinions of the Halifax Regional School Board. Will the minister explain today why she did an end run around the Halifax Regional School Board and why did she announce a capital project based on political needs rather than the requirements of the school board?</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, there's nothing about Kids and Learning First in this; it's votes and pork-barrelling first. It's funny the way the minister treats school boards. When something unpleasant has to be done, like millions of dollars in education cuts, she leaves it up to the school boards to do the work. But when it comes to making pork-barrel political school announcements, she doesn't even give them the courtesy of hearing what the priorities are.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, if the priorities are coming out on April 20th, how come the announcement was made before that? One of the reasons the Premier gave, with a straight face, for building the new high school is to house some students when renovations to another school are being done. That's laughable. I know you don't build a new house when you need to remodel the kitchen. My question to the minister is, will the minister admit today that her boss, the Premier, overreached when he gave the flimsy excuse for building a new school? Will she admit that her decision to build a school was for votes and pork-barrelling first?</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, the Cole Harbour area was actually identified many years ago when Howard Windsor was the superintendent. I know there has been a call for either skilled trades or a flexible school in Cole Harbour. This has been something that has been a priority for many people, the issue of providing Cole Harbour with skill trades. Following along with my comments on Kids and Learning First, this is providing the opportunity for students in all the surrounding areas to be able to get skills trade development right in their own community. I stand behind this decision, this is a good decision for Nova Scotians.</p>

We have put many initiatives in place over the last three years to address that. The fact is, what they don't understand on the other side is that it takes time to strategize and build a very strong foundation to go forward with any initiative. They don't know what the word "plan" means, they don't know what the word "strategy" means, everything in the past for them has been on an ad hoc basis and so that is why we take our time, so when we have the opportunity and we go forward with our plan it is a solid plan.</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, the gap between what men earn and women earn is increasing here in Nova Scotia - it's decreasing across Canada. Women and families are finding it harder to make ends meet. My question, did the Minister responsible for the Status of Women raise any concerns with her Cabinet colleagues about this increasing wage gap and how this government is making life more difficult for women and families to make ends meet?</p>

          <from>HON. MARILYN MORE</from>
          <p>HON. MARILYN MORE : Mr. Speaker, certainly for generations we've known that there has been a wage gap between men and women. Despite claims to the contrary, actually in Nova Scotia the wage gap is shrinking. Certainly when we look at the statistics available through Stats Canada, between 2008 and 2010 the median hourly wage for women increased by $2, whereas the median wage for men increased by $1.15. Now, that's not to deny that a lot of our service and domestic and lower-paying administrative and service jobs are predominately staffed by women, and that's one reason that our government is up-skilling, providing all kinds of training opportunities so that more and more women can move into the higher-paying full-time jobs in this province.</p>

          <from>MS. REGAN</from>
          <p>MS. REGAN : Just so the minister is aware, her government was not in in 2008. If you look at the Stats Can figures for 2009 on, in fact, the wage gap is increasing. Mr. Speaker, this government has slashed health budgets, and women make up over 80 per cent of the health workforce. These cuts affect women's employment and women will have to take on more caregiving responsibilities as this government puts off doing anything to reduce wait times.</p>

          <p>MS. MORE : I think we've always recognized that policy, budget, and legislative decisions impact differently on women than they do men, and that's one reason that our government has strengthened the gender-based analysis on all policy changes and recommended strategies in this province. We look very seriously at that lens and do that analysis. We have invested heavily in programs that support women going into non-traditional fields that often have higher-paying wages. Certainly this is a complex issue, and we are looking at a breadth of different solutions in order to increase women's prosperity in this province. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MS. REGAN : Over the past two years this NDP Government has slashed public education funding by $65 million. Women make up nearly 70 per cent of the education workforce. Women's employment is being affected by these cuts. When schools are looking for more volunteers to deliver the services, it's women who are going to end up filling that service gap, and above all, women are concerned that their children's education is suffering under this NDP Government.</p>

Certainly the breadth of factors that are taken into account when any decision is made by this government is as thorough and carefully analyzed as possible, and we are taking steps to mitigate any negative impacts. We have increased the breadth of up-skilling, of training, and of education programs for women and girls in this province. We are very encouraged with the uptake. Thank you.</p>

This isn't the kind of thing that I normally have an opportunity to talk about and I certainly claim no great insight or expertise into energy policy but I sure know a fair amount about the struggles that people have paying their electricity bills. In fact, I was involved in making a video back in the 1980s, called Disconnection, the Credit and Collection Practices of Nova Scotia Power. I made that videotape with some other people who I worked with at Dalhousie Legal Aid, a service for low-income families in the Gottingen Street area in the north end of Halifax, which I'm very proud now to represent. Because I had been working in this legal aid clinic for a couple of years and on a regular basis, I had to deal with disconnection notices and, in fact, the disconnection of electrical services to families, over a period of time and then negotiating with the power company.</p>

We have a plan that makes life more affordable for Nova Scotia families and we also have a price to wean ourselves off these harmful energy sources. I'm saying to the members opposite that the future generations will thank us. We have initiatives in tidal power, we have initiatives in solar power, we have initiatives in wind power, in fact, today we see Spark Energy saying that all of their turbines are up and running and we're delighted to see that reliance on wind energy. We have feed-in tariffs, we have natural gas, we'll have a diverse strategy and that strategy's aimed at Nova Scotia families and it's aimed at making life better for Nova Scotia families and for weaning ourselves from the harmful effects of that government and the energy sources that they relied on.
