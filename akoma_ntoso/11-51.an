          <from>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL</from>
          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Over a year ago, CBC reported there were too many nursing home beds empty; in fact at the time it was reported that at any given time there were about 100 empty beds and that initiatives were underway to increase the occupancy rates. Last evening a report was released by CBC highlighting the fact that wait lists for long-term care facilities continue to grow. There appears to be a supply and demand disconnect that continues to widen under this NDP Government and it's the seniors in this province - whether they are waiting in hospital or in community - are the victims of government's inaction.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this is not the case; in fact over the last two years we have either constructed, or have under construction, more than 1,000 long-term care beds. We have worked with the long-term care facility operators to smooth the transition from what is a single entry access list through into the beds that are actually serving those communities. The Leader of the Official Opposition is right - there is often a delay between the identification of the person at the top of the list and their acceptance of a bed in a particular facility, and this has created situations where if you add up the number of days, they amount to a substantial amount of unused bed time in these long-term care facilities. The minister, as part of the Continuing Care Strategy, has been working with the operators to try and minimize that loss of bed usage.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, that's what we thought was happening over a year ago and what we were looking for was some answers from the government on what initiatives they put in place the last year to reduce that delay. We all know in this House that seniors don't want to be in a nursing home; however, in the absence of any other substantive programs available, it becomes the only option available for families.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : As the Leader of the Official Opposition would know, the numbers with respect to bed vacancies, and indeed, the number of people who are in a community on any one day, or in a particular hospital on any one day, change because people are admitted or are transferred to facilities on a regular basis. But with respect to respite care, this is an important matter for communities. I would ask the Minister of Health and Wellness to provide the Leader of the Official Opposition with some information on this.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, what the Department of Health and Wellness has done is converted respite beds into long-term care beds. We had many respite beds throughout the province, some that were occupied as little as six per cent annually, sitting there, we were paying for them, they weren't being used; they're now being used and they are being used to take seniors off the waiting list so that they can have a long-term care bed.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : The purpose of a respite bed was to give caregivers at home a break with their loved one. Everyone in the province, if they actually understand what a respite bed is, would recognize there would not be full occupancy in a respite bed, Mr. Speaker. Quite frankly, as they've taken a number of respite beds off the list, not only have they put more pressure on caregivers at home but wait lists for accessing long-term care is growing under the government.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : When you have a circumstance where for 94 per cent of the time the bed is empty, surly even the Leader of the Official Opposition can understand that that bed is better used by actually having a senior in it and being provided with the care that they need. What the department is addressing and, really, what the most recent report underlines, is the necessity for the long-term care, continuing care model to change and we shouldn't be waiting until people get on the list for a long-term care facility, we should be providing them with support so that they can stay at home. We should be providing them with assisted living options and, in fact, that is exactly what the Department of Health and Wellness is doing.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I heard the Premier say a few moments ago, we built 1,100 long-term care beds, I can't help but ask who exactly he means by we because the fact of the matter is those beds were approved and funded four years ago in 2007. Yesterday, the CBC reported on the realities that Nova Scotians face today when it comes to long-term care. The fact of the matter is today there are 1,700 seniors in this province, like Shirley Dykens, whose two sisters, Nancy and Jean, are forced to care for her as she waits to get into a long-term care facility.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, that's not true, the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party knows it's not true. He knows that the strategy that was put in place by the previous government went out to 2016, not out to 2011, so in fact, the majority of that has been completed already. What we are doing, instead of waiting to get out to the 2016 date is looking at the kinds of supports, the kinds of programming that we could put in place in the community to help seniors be able to stay in their homes longer. We are reducing the wait list by reducing the necessity for that being the only option. That is the important piece that seniors in this province and those organizations that represent them are asking for.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the wait list to go into long-term care is going up. It is not being reduced; it is going up. The fact of the matter is that four years ago a plan was approved and funded to build 1,320 long-term care beds for that very reason. The Premier likes to take credit for the 1,100 that were built under that plan, but he won't even admit the truth: they cancelled the remaining 200, and wait lists are going up further because of it. In fact, it has been reported by CBC that wait lists have grown 35.5 per cent up to April of 2010.</p>

BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Department of Health and Wellness' own report indicates that there are 3,230 people in Nova Scotia who have been added to the wait list for long-term care in 2010. Some 37 per cent of those people were already in a hospital waiting for a long-term care bed; 36 per cent of that group lived in a community where there was no public home care funding, meaning that three-quarters of that group - 2,300 people - need a long-term care bed to get the care that they need. The Premier says we need a strategy, but there's no strategy.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday in an answer to a reporter's question, the Premier said that there was no job crisis in rural Nova Scotia. Statistics Canada data shows that over the past year 6,600 people have lost work outside of Halifax while 9,800 have given up and exited the workforce. That is 9,800 people losing hope - that is equivalent to the entire Town of Bridgewater. My question to the Premier is, why is the Premier ignoring the crisis in rural Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this is the government that has brought 3,000 new jobs to Nova Scotia over the last two years since we were elected. This is the government that has made investments in Shelburne, in Yarmouth County, in Cape Breton. We have made investments right across the Province of Nova Scotia, in Amherst, in Colchester. That's where we are investing our money to help businesses in rural Nova Scotia create good jobs so that people can live there and raise their families there.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, this is the government that has lost 12,500 jobs since they've taken office in June 2009. In this year alone they lost 6,600 jobs in rural Nova Scotia, under this Premier's watch. The Premier seems to take job losses lightly. We have a clear crisis outside of Halifax and yet day after day he stands in this House blaming others instead of insisting on real action that will make a difference for those Nova Scotians. Things like completely overhauling the tax structure to make our province more competitive, in the process ensuring that all Nova Scotians have the opportunity to get back to work in the communities in which they live.</p>

The very organizations that the Premier talks about and boasts about supporting with his government are the very people who are standing outside complaining about first contract arbitration. He's ignoring them then and he's ignoring the fact that 12,500 people have lost their jobs under his government. The Premier has hiked the HST by 2 per cent. This Premier increased over 1,400 user fees outside the Legislature.

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, since this government decided to cancel the international ferry link from Yarmouth to New England, the entire region of southwestern Nova Scotia has been suffering. Not only has this government killed one of the largest economic drivers of southwestern Nova Scotia, their lack of a real economic strategy with targets and measurable goals has made the region suffer even more. In the last year employment in southwestern Nova Scotia dropped by 2,500 jobs. My question to the Premier is why has he allowed 2,500 jobs to be lost in southwestern Nova Scotia?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out to the member opposite, in fact, the number of jobs in the Province of Nova Scotia has gone up some 3,000 over the last couple of years. There are, in fact, differences from county to county and that has been the historic nature of the job market in this province. I can tell you this, when we're investing in the Shelburne shipyards, when we're investing in A.F. Theriault &amp; Son, when we're investing in Allendale Electronics, we're doing that on the South Shore, we're doing that in southwestern Nova Scotia in order to be able to create more jobs for those communities.</p>

I'd be happy to give him the Statistics Canada reference if he needs it but the simple fact of the matter is for the first time in this province, there is a detailed economic plan that focuses on innovation, on competitiveness, in investments, in companies who have asked us to help them in very specific ways.

If he gets tired of listening to the numbers here in the House, he can come to my community in Yarmouth and talk to businesses that have closed. He can go to Cape Breton and talk to people that are out of work.

We have consistently opened new long-term care beds. We're halfway through the continuing care strategy. There are more beds to be built; there are more beds that we are doing planning for. It's not accurate that there's been a cancellation of long-term care beds. Beds continue to be added into the system.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, indeed, being a caregiver for an elderly parent or a sibling is a very stressful situation. All of the research points to that. If you know caregivers, if you've been one yourself, you know this. That's why this government has introduced three programs to assist seniors to be in their own homes and get support. We've introduced a Caregiver Benefit, we've introduced the Supportive Care Program, and we've introduced the Personal Alert system for seniors who are in danger of falling because they have already fallen.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. On October 12th, the minister announced a properly regulated methadone program for the Annapolis Valley. While the news was initially welcomed, its success was short lived. The program now, only six weeks old, has a wait list and those on the list can only receive an assessment - no treatment. My question to the minister is, is this not indicative of a problem much larger than the minister was willing to admit?</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, as the minister well knows, we are now closing in on one year since this issue came to the forefront. People who need methadone in the Valley are now once again forced to wait. As of today we have had 53 people attempting to seek help - 22 are receiving treatment while 31 people are left in limbo. Any new cases will receive an assessment only with the holdup being an issue of insufficient staff resources. Who knows how long it will take to ensure adequate staff resources and how many we will lose as they slip back into the vicious cycle.</p>

However, in the report last week, tabled by the Auditor General, it was revealed there was a lack of an appeal process for a person who has been accused of such abuse.

          <p>MR. TREVOR ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, NSGEU Local 26 - Cobequid Housing Authority is made of 36 members employed in the Truro and Amherst offices. They currently manage 893 senior units; 258 family units; provide management services to Colliston House in Truro, an 18-unit disabled accessible building; support workers provide emergency services to tenants in the Truro H.A. Johnson Manor; and manage 600 family units, rural and native housing, across the province. Each member takes great pride in those they serve and the work that they conduct each day.</p>

          <p>MS. DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE: I do realize, as the Minister of Community Services, that when there are contract negotiations taking place, there is often a lot of emotion surrounding that and there is also a lot of misinformation that gets out there. That's why we don't get involved on the floor talking about those types of negotiations. That's why it needs to sit in with the collective bargaining process. We've seen over and over how that type of process has been very successful, and we're sure we'll that again.</p>

          <p>MR. ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, last April NSGEU Local 47 - Metropolitan Regional Housing Authority walked off the job as they were not called back to the table by the minister's own department to negotiating a fair and collective agreement. Knowing that this could happen again in the next coming days for Local 26 is simply irresponsible and it hurts everyone involved, including the seniors, families, and children that these members serve.</p>

          <p>MR. ZINCK : Mr. Speaker, this is a process of give and take. However, the government has not proposed to offer anything for the Local 26 members' classifications or even suggested doing a review of jobs and classifications as per the review process used in the civil service. At a time when we're debating Bill No. 102 - which ironically carries the title "an Act to Prevent Unnecessary Labour Disruptions" - this minister continues to sit silent and see these members treated as second-class employees.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, on April 26, 2011, I asked the Minister of Agriculture about the status of the Land Review Committee's report. At the time, the minister told us that the report had gone to an interdepartmental committee and that recommendations would be coming out later in the Spring. My question to the Minister of Agriculture is, where are the recommendations?</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Yes, a good question. The land review report is basically done. I'll let the member know that. I was briefed on it two weeks ago, I'll say - somewhere in that range. Although I have some very good information I felt there was one thing for sure that I would like to see in place before we release the report. It was around the statements of provincial interest and particularly for the preservation of farm land, which I find is a statement that's a little vague. I'd like to see that tightened up.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that response. The minister also informed us at the time that his department was putting the nuts and bolts to the NDP's lacklustre Homegrown Success agricultural plan. The minister stated that his department was putting together a five-year program for the 10-year plan - more than a little confusing for Nova Scotians and farmers who seek clarity from the NDP Government on agricultural policy. My question to the minister is, when will this new, five-year program be completed and available to the public?</p>

I don't have a date on that. I think that five-year nuts and bolts are just about complete, but I can verify that and get back to the member.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, for weeks now our entire caucus has been questioning the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism about his approach to economic development. We have pointed out there is not one target in his plan, not one measurable outcome for success. This strategy is not working and the minister does know better. If he were forced to give this a grade during his time at Henson College, he would have no choice but to give it an F. It's Business 101 - if you don't have targets, if you don't have numbers or outcomes, if you don't have anything you could measure, well, you don't have business, and you certainly have no business being in business development.</p>

We have - and I, as minister - not only have faith in the jobsHere strategy, the jobsHere plan, but also have faith and confidence in the good staff that we have who are implementing that plan. I will further add, we have faith in the Irving shipyard, we have faith in all of the corporate citizens of Nova Scotia, that we will employ as many people as humanly possible.</p>

          <p>MR.

The targets are obviously important, without them we don't have anything but a marketing plan, so I'm very concerned that the minister would stand here and say the targets don't matter. Of course they matter - we're talking about public dollars, we're using taxpayers' dollars for these programs.</p>

In the last year employment everywhere in Nova Scotia went down, except for Halifax. Cape Breton is down 2,100 jobs; the North Shore is down 1,400 jobs; the Annapolis Valley is down 600 jobs; and southern Nova Scotia is down 2,500 jobs - for a total loss of 6,600 jobs.</p>

The bottom line is that we came into power at a time when things in Nova Scotia were dormant. What we've done is, since we've been in power the fact is we've created 3,000 jobs. That is a fact and, you know, we will continue, we have the strategy. The strategy is working.

          <p>MR. JIM MORTON : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to stand here today to speak to the resolution. I appreciated the rather quiet tone of the Leader of the Official Opposition, although I must say I found the tone of the resolution itself rather alarmist and certainly emotional, and not very helpful.</p>

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : I rise in my place today to speak of the impact the NDP policies have had on Nova Scotia: raising taxes by 2 per cent on the HST; raising user fees, over 1,400 in total, Mr. Speaker. It costs more today to get a driver's licence, to get a fishing licence, to do almost everything that you have to get a licence for. They've been standing by while their bite-the-bullet electricity plan pushes power rates sky high and they've been using the URB to say that this is going to happen and most recently their misguided approach to labour laws. All of those things combined to make Nova Scotia uncompetitive in the job market.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Yesterday, just outside the Chamber, the Premier said: I disagree that there is a crisis. Who do we believe, Mr. Speaker, the people of Nova Scotia, the business owners or the NDP Government? I know who I believe, I believe the people in my constituency who I talk to who say there is a crisis. I believe the people who have to leave and go out West, who tell me there's a crisis. Sweeping it under the rug and pretending it doesn't exist won't make it go away.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased today to stand in my place to speak to the resolution. It is indeed, all about the current economic climate that we are experiencing in Nova Scotia. In talking to the business community, I think what they're laying out, is in fact, the cumulative effect of policies of this government, plus the economic times in which we live but, you know, the HST hike is, in fact, taking its toll now.</p>

          <p>MR. GARY BURRILL : Mr. Speaker, with this Resolution No. 2245, we have, I think this evening, a particularly challenging text to deal with, before us, challenging from the point of trying to find a place where this text can be positively and constructively engaged. The resolution expresses itself with a great deal of negativity, several different times, in various ways, on the question of taxation and then it moves from that into a general kind of condemnatory, negative statement about the government as a whole. It is difficult and challenging to find a way to constructively engage a discourse or a text, a resolution, that is as wrapped up as this one seems to me to be in an overall fog of negativity.</p>

He's more than capable of carrying that conversation and we appreciate that. (Applause) I think that's good to hear from those people out there.

I certainly would also like to join the member for Hants West in recognizing the member for Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley. I kind of felt like I was doing some Adam Smith economics during my time at Dal, so I missed you on a couple of words, they were lost on me, but in any event, I thought it was very well done and your points are well taken. We probably disagree on a few of those but in all seriousness, it was very well delivered and I certainly appreciate your passion in what you just said.
