          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Thank you Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. The Premier is preparing to spend $90 million on a deal with Bowater. The Premier needs to provide his justification for such an agreement to spend $90 million of taxpayers' money. My question to the Premier, will the Premier release all the information material related to the agreement signed to give $90 million to Bowater?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the agreement with Bowater Mersey, I think, in total was $50 million. Part of that, of course, was the purchase of land which was for $23.75 million, which will be a benefit to the people of Nova Scotia for generations to come; $25 million of that had to do with the investment in new efficiency processes within the mill that will allow the mill to bring down its cost per ton; and $1.5 million of that is for workforce retraining so that when the new technical aspects of the mill are in place those workers will have the ability to operate the plant. If there is anything else that the Leader of the Official Opposition would like to know, I would be happy to provide it to him, and he will have an opportunity to say whether or not he supports this agreement shortly.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier forgot the additional $40 million that he has signed into this agreement that he can spend out to Bowater to buy land, that that money can also join the $23.7 million that he is going to give them to go to Quebec to pay down a debt and not invest into the community and not invest in the workers in this province.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course we did work with respect to the competitiveness of the mills. That information is proprietary; it has to do with the actual competitive nature of the mills themselves. It's important that we not turn that information over to the competitors of the mills so they can then do damage to their economic prospects. I'm sure the Leader of the Official Opposition understands that.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I would assume that the Premier did not only commission the report to deal specifically with Bowater, he was looking at the paper industry globally, not specifically to Bowater. I would hope that he's not showing preferential treatment to one mill in this province and not looking at the rest of them.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I can say is that the Nova Scotia Jobs Fund is an important part of the work that we do in the province in order to be able to support and maintain jobs in the province. As I understand it, that fund operated in the usual manner.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it seemed like a relatively straightforward question. On June 29, 2010, the Premier named five Nova Scotians with a range of business and investment experience, to the Industrial Expansion Fund Advisory Committee, saying at the time, "By having an independent committee review potential investments before they go to the minister, it will ensure we continue to make smart investments that create good jobs . . .

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Between $50 million and $90 million has been committed by the Premier to Bowater in Liverpool. However, the details of exactly where this money is going to come from are scarce. We know that there is $25 million that will be handed out from the Industrial Expansion Fund - which was just brought forward by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, and apparently the Premier forgot to ask his own advisory board - but, Mr. Speaker, that leaves an additional $23.7 million which is unaccounted for.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, very shortly the Minister of Finance will be in a position to table the quarterly update with respect to the province's finances. All of the liabilities of the province and the revenue projections will be available at that time, and we'll be able to provide the Leader of the Official Opposition with the details as to how that will be accounted for on the books.</p>

          <from>MR. MCNEIL</from>
          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier has told the Minister of Health and Wellness to cut $46 million out of health care. He told municipalities he was going to break a promise we had with them - the MOU. Many Nova Scotians are looking forward, unfortunately, to seeing a tax increase on their property taxes because of that agreement. As part of this deal with Bowater, there's an extra $40 million that has been set aside that the Premier can use as he sees fit. The Minister of Natural Resources said to the media outside that he believed the $23.7 million was coming from his department, but he would need to ask government and Cabinet for more money to offset that. Considering he can't find $23.7 million, I think he's going to find it very difficult to find an additional $40 million on top of that.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think first I ought to explain to the Leader of the Official Opposition how an option works. An option, you see, is a benefit to the person who purchases it, not to the person who gives it. It is the opportunity for us to be able to purchase highly valuable property from Bowater should we decide to do so. That is the benefit conferred on the province as a result of the option. Maybe now he understands it.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the option in this case may mean that if Bowater needs more money, call up the Premier and I'll write you a cheque. That could be what we're talking about. It's rather ironic that the Premier talks about buying valuable land with this additional $40 million, since he can't tell this House, or any other Nova Scotians, what pieces or parcels of land he's buying with the $23.7 million that he has already committed to.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Premier. In 2008, the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council produced an in-depth study and strategy on building competitiveness in Atlantic Canada's forest industry - and I'll table that study. According to the report, North American standard newsprint shipments dropped 40 per cent in a short, seven-year period. Bowater's predominant product produced in Liverpool is standards newsprint.</p>

The federal government gave us an update at our meeting. They called for research proposals, which were due November 30th, and they told us that the successful research team would be in place in March. Provinces will have an opportunity to participate based on the successful research team, and we will have to await those details.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the agreement that the Premier signed with Bowater has left Nova Scotians with many important questions. One of these questions is that there are no guarantees that the 220 workers at the plant will have job security. In fact, when questioned yesterday on this subject, the Premier referred to increasing productivity and efficiency.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of - not the Leader, not yet the Leader, anyway. As the member for Glace Bay would know, the agreement between the mill and the union, with respect to the changes that are going to be made to the collective agreement, covers the questions associated with the workforce, with the manner in which the difficult questions of seniority will be dealt with. What we did is, we entered into an agreement that will provide for the operation of both of the paper machines over the next five years.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the Premier's contract requires that Bowater reports payroll numbers, but doesn't go any steps further. It is void of guarantees that any of the 220 employees, as we discussed, at Bowater will have any job security for the life of the agreement itself, let alone when the $50-$90 million deal winds up. Why would the Premier sign an agreement and spend between $50-$90 million as identified without any guarantees of job security for the 220 workers at the mill?</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the reality is that the region of southern Nova Scotia is already suffering from massive job losses. In the last year StatsCan reports that there have been 1,700 jobs lost in the region year to date and that employment dropped 2.2 per cent with the labour force contracting by 5 per cent over the same period from last year. The last thing the taxpayers of Nova Scotia need is a $50-$90 million deal which doesn't guarantee any jobs. The Premier needs to answer clearly and honestly - will any of the 220 employees left at Bowater lose their job during the life of this agreement?</p>

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, a key piece of the Bowater equation is missing. The Premier is set to put $50 million to $90 million into Bowater without giving Nova Scotians the full story about this deal.

          <p>MR. CHURCHILL : Mr. Speaker, part of this government's potential $90 million deal includes a land purchase of $23.75 million.

The only people in this province who don't see this as a problem happen to sit on the government side of the House. The reality is the members of the government have zero experience in creating jobs and they have the results to prove it.</p>

We need only look as far as the sham Labour Management Review Committee to find a prime example. At a time when the government should be working with job creators to dig ourselves out of the hole they put us in, they've ensured that 85 per cent of Nova Scotian employees' workplaces are not represented on that committee.</p>

They are providing us with good advice. The jobsHere strategy was based on the advice from the business people in this province. The workforce strategy was a product of those very job creators.

          <p>MS. WHALEN : A rider, there you go - an additional rider, which opts them out of the cap and they could say we don't want to be held to the provisions of the cap if, in fact, we're injured - we want to have the greater recourse to go through the courts or to get perhaps more compensation and help should we be injured. So that will be an additional and perhaps a costly feature that might be brought in. We're not sure what that's going to cost but, because it's complicated, I know it's taking another year to bring forward.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Madam Speaker, I won't spend too much time on this one. For many years, I believe, especially in southwestern Nova Scotia, there has always been a bit of controversy when it comes to fishing organizations in the area, where many times, even when I was minister and, of course, just being a member of the community, where we hear from different people who are continually questioning decisions made by other organizations. The best example really is District 34, the LFA 34 Advisory Committee, where a lot of times there are a number of decisions that of course are made by the president or the chairman, made by the port reps, that sometimes don't represent, I believe, the views of the fishermen or of other areas.</p>

          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : Thank you Madam Speaker, I just want to rise in my place to say a few words on this bill. As the minister knows, and probably the member from Argyle, we've tried for years to be organized in the fishing industry. Every time we did get together and get partly or somewhat organized, it didn't seem to make any difference, especially when it came to Ottawa and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. They didn't seem to want to recognize anybody unless they had millions of dollars in their pocket and wanted to take up and clean the fleet out and have it all to themselves; that is what always seemed to have happened in the inshore fishery.</p>

          <p>MR. THERIAULT : I'm still talking lobster. (Laughter). It's the truth, try it and you get a good Fall lobster. Not all the lobsters are bad it just seems to be getting &#x2013; year after year here, the last three or four years, the lobsters have gotten a little softer because each year here &#x2013; look at the weather outside here in December, it's warm, it's like September weather, so the lobsters every year they seem to be getting a few more softer ones and there's less meat in them, and they're not filling out so quickly. They fill out as that water temperature goes down. That's when you get the good lobster, so that's when we've got to go after those lobsters that are soft now. Anyway, if we can tell the fishermen to do that and we can improve the lobsters in Nova Scotia, lobster fishing, and if this bill will help us get organized (Interruptions)</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Madam Speaker, I just rise in support of this bill. I had an opportunity to talk to the Finance Minister about this bill the other day and I think it's a kind of a bill that's going to enhance what was already in place in terms of tax credits for opportunities in this province, particularly in my area, in Cape Breton, and I can point to a number of investments that were made in Cape Breton in the past couple of years that perhaps would not have taken place had the equity tax credit not been available at that time. This bill only enhances that and it strengthens it, but it gives some continuity to equity tax credits for, I believe it's for the next 10 years at least, but anyway, I just wanted to rise and congratulate the Finance Minister on bringing this forward, because I think it's going to give some certainty to some of the people in our area who are wishing to invest in new opportunities on Cape Breton Island. Thank you very much.</p>

I've skied periodically over the years and, interestingly enough, last year was the first year I ever wore a helmet skiing &#x2013; I actually own one now. I promptly bought a helmet and crashed down the hill at Wentworth but the interesting thing about the helmet was, my first observation was, wow, this is warmer than wearing a hat. So I certainly thought that was a good enough reason right there to be wearing one.</p>

I live just minutes away from Martock and have been there many times. My children all go there and certainly they wear helmets. I think I could probably safely say there are 95-plus per cent of the people on that hill who likely have a helmet on. As has already been said, the racers and a lot of others do. I can say that probably only in the last year or so have I started wearing a helmet as well. (Interruption) Too late, he says.</p>

It has been of much debate in this House, I know it has been of much debate across part of the South Shore and, unfortunately, not the fullest of debate because the citizens and community of the South Shore didn't realize that the mill was in trouble in August, when the Premier found out, and I assume - I can only assume - that was the same time that the member found out, that the issue happened in August and the community became aware of it much later on.</p>
