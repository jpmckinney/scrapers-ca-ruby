          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker that will be a cold comfort to Nova Scotians who are faced with the reality of a 6.1 per cent increase in their power bills this year. If this 6.1 per cent wasn't enough of a burden for homeowners to bear in the new year, they will also carry the NDP electricity tax set to rise again in January, 2012. The DSM charge, which the NDP didn't support in Opposition, now is creating an even greater burden on the ratepayers. My question to the Premier is, will the government freeze the DSM charge so ratepayers will not have to pay an increase to NDP electricity charge?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to cloud these things by talking about a demand-side management charge which, of course, this government had nothing to do with. What's more important here is the question of what it is that the Opposition is suggesting; they are suggesting that nothing happen on the electricity side. It is, in fact, the programming that is put in place through that charge, through Efficiency Nova Scotia, which allows consumers to be able to reduce their energy costs and therefore reduce the overall cost of energy in their household. For whatever reason the members opposite are opposed to energy efficiency, they are opposed to ensuring that consumers are able to spend less on their power.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : No, Mr. Speaker, we believe shareholders should pay that. Unlike the Premier we're not flip-flopping on arbitration. With the general rate increase, the NDP electricity tax, and Nova Scotia ratepayers will be faced with increases associated with the fuel adjustment mechanism; it's simply too much for Nova Scotians to bear and the Premier has done nothing to truly address power rates in Nova Scotia. My question to the Premier is, when can Nova Scotians expect their government to stand up for them and not Nova Scotia Power?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, fortunately Mr. Speaker, the people of Nova Scotia have a government that is standing up for them and getting them off of the rollercoaster of fossil fuels, signing agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador to access the Lower Churchill Power project, ensuring that we have a renewable electricity plan that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels, and making sure that the HST comes off home energy costs. Mr. Speaker, I would point out that - something that actually saves ratepayers money - is something that the Opposition voted against.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, if there were ever a time for the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party to apologize to the people of Nova Scotia, it would be today. The simple fact of the matter is, the reason why we find ourselves in the position where the Utility and Review Board has to make this decision is because for a decade the former Progressive Conservative Government refused to engage in a renewable electricity plan that would get Nova Scotians off of fossil fuels and prevent the kind of roller coaster that we have seen in power rates that is directly attributable to the decisions of the past government.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the only apology that's due here is the Premier's for the escalator, the ever up-going escalator that he has put Nova Scotians on starting with Nova Scotia households who today are facing a 6.1 per cent increase in their rates on top of the 3.2 per cent that was previously approved - over 9 per cent for every Nova Scotia household. Whether you're a senior on a fixed income or a single-parent family, every single household has their power rates going up and up.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, our electricity plan is designed to get the people of Nova Scotia off of fossil fuels to reduce our dependency on the international fossil fuel markets so that we will have stable, long-term energy rates. That is something the previous government refused to do and as a result, the cost of coal, which is directly reflected in our rates, has risen 75 per cent. That is as a result of the decisions made by the former government.</p>

The workers at Bowater, under excruciating circumstances, have done their part. The monitor at NewPage is doing his part to find a buyer that will operate that mill as a going concern. Why won't the Premier do his own part and rewrite his bite-the-bullet plan so that Nova Scotians can get a break?</p>

STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, today the URB also delivered their decision with respect to NewPage and Bowater raising the rates for the general rate application and further increasing power bills across the board.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I agree that the Utility and Review Board has done its job in terms of considering the range or the balance of interests that exist in the province. What I disagree with, of course, is the question of why it is that we are forced to accept these kinds of rate increases. That happens because past governments refused to get us off of fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the board only offered a three-year load retention rate rather than the five-year application that the mills were asking for. So in a strange way, while this is a concession for the ratepayers, it is a blow to the mills. The mills don't get what they want but the ratepayers are getting higher power bills and nobody wins. My question to the Premier is, considering that both NewPage and Bowater have stressed very strongly that they needed the load retention rate to stay in business, what is the Premier going to do to make sure those mills continue to operate?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what I can tell the Leader of the Official Opposition is that we are in active negotiations and talks with Bowater. They have a whole series of issues, but interestingly enough, one of the things that they're looking at very closely is the question of energy efficiency, the question of how they go about actually reducing their power costs by reducing energy consumption. That is a concept that is directly applicable to residential ratepayers as well. It was one of the reasons why we wanted to see a comprehensive, across-the-board energy efficiency program that will help people spend less on energy.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, strangely enough, both of these mills pay the DSM charge yet do not have access to that money to create the energy efficiency that the Premier has been talking about. This decision sets a dangerous precedent for Nova Scotians. As you know, this decision applies to the two largest industrial users in the province, but as all Nova Scotians know, there are other industrial users across Nova Scotia, from Sobeys to Bragg, Oxford Frozen Foods, and the list goes on. My question to the Premier is, how will the Premier address this matter now that the precedent has been set by the URB today and make sure that all Nova Scotia businesses have access to fair power rates?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I hope the Premier can appreciate the frustration businesses are feeling. Here we have the largest single private-sector employer in the Province of Nova Scotia, and the Premier - or his government, or the three MLAs who represent Pictou County - would not call them and invite them to participate in a study day on a piece of legislation that will have a great impact on their business. The Labour Management Review Committee left Sobeys, the province's largest employer, out of this study day on a policy that could have a profound impact on Sobeys' future investment and job creation here in the Province of Nova Scotia. The Labour Management Review Committee has no non-union representation and is making decisions that have a direct impact on non-unionized workplaces.</p>

It is his government that threw us off that path, that upset the apple cart, and made decisions that are leading to power rate increases like we see today.

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Well, Mr. Speaker, based on the cheap legislation tabled by the Minister of Justice yesterday, it's very clear that his priority is not on dealing with violent crime in the Province of Nova Scotia. This is the same Minister of Justice who has been busy finding ways to cut back programs in his department in order to comply with the Finance Minister's budget directives. This is a government that made significant cuts to the Department of Justice at a time when Nova Scotians are looking for leadership and looking for a plan to deal with violent crime.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education. The Hogg formula, which is used to distribute funds to school boards, is currently under review and I believe that's a good thing. Interviews have been completed. Boards have had both their high level and their detailed presentations, and the deadline for submissions from boards in response to what they have received is November 30th, which is tomorrow. So my question to the Minister of Education is, will the results of the current Hogg formula review have any effect on the funding to boards for 2012-13?</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, that concerns me because we know that information is at the Department of Finance. We know that the Department of Health and Wellness has received theirs. My question is why the second largest funded department in the province would not have their funding. Boards have not been given their funding targets; they have no preliminary profile sheets; they have no idea what the review will do or what impact it will have. So my question to the minister is, will she commit to supporting school boards in their budget-building process and provide them with the information they need - now?</p>

It was shocking that this minister would celebrate a fiction and call something a success when every imaginable indicator proves it's a failure. For instance, last week allnovascotia.com reported that from October 2009 until October 2011, employment throughout the province was down by 5,000 and areas of the province outside of Halifax lost 7,900 jobs between the April and June period in 2009, and the same period in 2011.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy. The importance of upgrades to the grid cannot be understated. The Premier made an announcement in 2010, which I will table, that an upgrade would be made to the grid and lines between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. We were obviously happy that the Premier took our suggestions, since the Liberals have been talking about it since 2008, and made it part of the campaign in 2009 - however, we haven't heard anything about it since. Would the Minister of Energy provide us with an update on this important project?</p>

Energy Ministers from the four Maritime Provinces have met regularly, looking at how we can co-operate and work together.

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, as you know, we are always looking for the best possible buy for electrical energy in this province, and we are continuing to work with our partners. The truth is that the infrastructure, the electrical transmission system, is just not up to grade at this point in time. It's just not possible to bring in large quantities of electricity from the Province of Quebec, but when the Lower Churchill project is in place, the transmission grid will be improved, will be upgraded, and then we'll be able to look at other options from other renewable sources.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, I love it when the government keeps parroting that line that Emera has already said is incorrect. The Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec study said that the infrastructure is in place. They said there's some upgrading needed on the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick line, but Muskrat Falls can't go ahead without that upgrading either, and the Premier is committed to that. The fact of the matter is, if that line has to be upgraded anyhow - I would hope the minister can actually multi-task and not just work on one project, so he should be on the phone with Hydro-Qu&#xE9;bec making those deals now.</p>

He should know that we signed a memorandum of understanding with the New Brunswick Government around the transmission upgrades. That work is continuing. It involves not just Emera, but also the New Brunswick utility. There are many questions associated with strengthening the regional grid. In fact, the Minister of Energy and myself, along with officials from our departments, are working on all of those things in order to strengthen the energy landscape in the region.</p>

When the electricity goes on the grid and the electrons are put in there, how do you know for sure where it's coming from? It's a complicated mix from various sources.

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, it's with mixed feelings that I rise to speak on Bill No. 116, an Act to Amend Chapter 5 of the Acts of 2011, the Elections Act, because it was just mere months ago that we were discussing this very issue which the government seeks to amend today. As I said before, for a Party that spent its entire existence in Opposition telling Nova Scotians how they would do things differently, this is but one more example of how things changed the minute they got a taste of power. The minute they got a taste of a majority all the ideals, all the goals of how they would do things differently, went out the door and I'm going to give examples of that as I speak for a few minutes on this.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I said before, if the minister has something to say, let him stand in his place and say it. I think at least his constituents should hear what he has to say, rather than the clucking that we are hearing from across the floor right now - hot air from this side.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I just have a couple of quick comments on the bill. With respect to the removal of the year of birth, the Progressive Conservatives also opposed this on third reading, and we remain opposed to it. This amendment fixes an obvious flaw in the original piece of legislation that was brought to the Legislature here at the last sitting. No one asked for this info that we are aware of, and certainly nobody in our Party wants that kind of information. So we welcome the amendment.</p>

          <p>MR. ZACH CHURCHILL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know we hear time and time again that this government is creating jobs, that first contract arbitration is going to support the economy. What members of this government don't voice in this House is that every single employer in the province, every one of them, the big ones like Oxford Frozen Foods; Michelin; Sobeys, the biggest private sector employer in the province, employs over 10,000 people; all the stakeholders who represent business; the chambers of commerce; the Canadian Federation of Independent Business; retailers; construction workers; road builders; everybody, every single employer in this province opposes this piece of legislation - big ones that employ thousands of Nova Scotians - and yet this government stands up in this House and says, we're listening to employers. We're supporting business. We're supporting economic development.</p>
