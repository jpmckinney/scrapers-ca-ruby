STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier revealed that his government had commissioned a secret $85,000 study on the viability of the Muskrat and alternatives to this project. My question to the Premier is, why did the Premier withhold the fact that the study has been underway since September?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the important fact here, of course, is that the study is being done, an analysis is being done to compare all of the alternatives for Muskrat Falls to ensure that Nova Scotians get the fairest and lowest power rates. That is our commitment. Our commitment is to make sure that the project is well researched, well analyzed, that the appropriate models are put in place, and I don't think this would come as a surprise to the Leader of the Opposition. We don't want to be in a position where the Utility and Review Board is just relying on the opinion generated by Emera or by Nova Scotia Power. So it's in the best interests of the people of Nova Scotia that the report be done and be done well in advance of the Utility and Review Board.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Premier unveiled that his government is doing a secret study on Muskrat Falls for months. Not only did he keep it a secret from the people of Nova Scotia, but at least on two occasions during emergency debate in this House, on the very topic of an independent review of Muskrat Falls, the Premier failed to disclose that he was doing just such a review.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the renewable energy administrator was designed to impartially determine which projects were best able to meet the needs of Nova Scotians on the renewable energy, or the renewable electricity plan. That plan will actually deliver the most stable rates that this province has seen in its history, because it will be part of an integrated energy portfolio that will allow us to keep rates at the lowest possible price for ratepayers.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Premier. Continuing on with this secret contract, the Premier spent a lot of time saying why Mr. Dalton was chosen. I think we all know why Mr. Dalton was chosen, and it was because the government didn't want somebody truly independent. The draft RFP for the round of renewable energy procurement, prepared by Mr. Dalton, was heavily criticized by the consumer advocate. Mr. Dalton refused to accept any of the fundamental changes because the rules set by the government wouldn't allow such changes.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the Dalton company was chosen after an exhaustive review where there were proposals brought forward examined as to their completeness, and he was chosen because not only of the past expertise that he had but because he was able to do an analysis of these projects in a completely independent fashion. So this is serving the most basic needs in our system, one where all of the applications that came forward were being reviewed transparently, independently, and fairly.</p>

Today, of all days, this province needs to address this issue, not just from the top down but with the grassroots community organizations that actually make recommendations and offer perspectives based on their work with thousands of women and children impacted by violence in this province.

It's them that we should be focused on and not what's important to the minister and I would only further say that rather than spending his time making up what he believes is the philosophy of the Progressive Conservatives, perhaps he should read the reports of his own government because the Intimate Partner Violence Tracking Project reports that when a sentence of probation is imposed on a domestic violence offender, in 87 per cent of guilty cases they're released on probation.</p>

          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. In December 2009, government produced a report recommending that a satellite dialysis unit at Digby be given high priority consideration, and I'll table that. Today the dialysis machine sits idle and residents of Digby still travel the longest distance in the province for this life-saving treatment.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, we know that patients who have to gain access to dialysis services often have the burden of time-consuming travel to receive that care. That's why we asked for consultation to try to figure out what the true picture looked like in the province when it comes to those individuals, those Nova Scotians gaining access to dialysis services.</p>

          <p>MR. THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, on April 4, 2012, the Deputy Minister of Health and Wellness, while appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, stated, "We have individuals in Digby who have to travel farther . . . if we had the money to move a dialysis centre, we would go to Digby first because of the greater distance they have to travel than any other individual in this province." I'll table those quotes.</p>

          <from>MR. WILSON</from>
          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, as I said, there's no question that finances of the province play a role in how we address services, especially in health care here in our province. Knowing that, as we make investments - the investments that we just made and future investments - we'll continue to look at areas of the province. That's why we recently made the announcement in the investment in Kentville, because we looked at the region of the province. If we have only a limited amount of finances to provide additional services for dialysis, what area and in what community would it have the most impact on Nova Scotians? Placing it in Kentville has the most impact on the number of people we can address and hopefully improve the services.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, it was learned recently that the YMCA and pool facility at Nova Scotia Community College's Akerley Campus is under threat of closure. Five years ago a deal was reached between the Nova Scotia Community College, the YMCA, HRM and the province to keep the facility open which is a resource used by students, the community, the Boys and Girls Club and many others. Now it seems it may close because the province and the Nova Scotia Community College seem unwilling to consider creative options to expand classroom space without removing the pool and that's despite the fact that the province put $0.5 million into renovating the pool just a few years ago.</p>

          <p>MS. MORE : Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind the honourable member that our legislation consolidated the Labour Board. Most of those appointments, quite frankly, were made by previous governments. (Interruptions) I also want to remind everyone in this Chamber that men and women across this country have a constitutional right to collective bargaining. So the Labour Board followed its normal procedure around determining which employees were eligible to vote on the application and the Labour Board's decision, as he has referenced, is being appealed and because that matter is before the courts, I cannot comment further.</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, normally in most workplaces, all employees within a certain job classification are eligible to vote on unionization. They must be present on the date of the certification application and the date of the vote. In the case of Egg Studios this did not happen. The NDP's new Labour Board made an exception and found that 11 technical workers engaged on one particular day were eligible to vote. More to the point, only five of them voted. There's simply no way of determining whether a majority of these workers even wanted to unionize.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. Nicholas Carroll is a young man from Margaree. He undertook a two-year program at the Nova Scotia Community College and today he is doing something he couldn't do here. He is working in Alberta. In Alberta, Nicholas found non-unionized work, and then he flew home to Sydney to pick up his apprenticeship papers. He returned months later only to discover that the time he spent working in Alberta would not count toward getting his apprenticeship papers.</p>

I would suggest, as I've offered for all members in this House, if they have a particular situation, to bring it to the department and we'll try to work through it. But on the broader issue, it is true that Alberta doesn't recognize the hours through the pre-apprenticeship program here in Nova Scotia. We are in negotiations with that province to show the quality of the programming here in Nova Scotia, and I am very hopeful that we will get equal recognition and an articulation agreement in place.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, maybe it wasn't such a bad question after all. Young people like Nicholas rarely want to head to Alberta or elsewhere. They would much rather stay closer to home and closer to family. The problem stems from a lack of jobs here in this province. For Nova Scotians heading to Alberta for work, the only way they can get their apprenticeship papers signed is if they can find union work, because the union must become the employer or else the work experience does not count. To help people like Nicholas, this has to change.</p>

In order to allow that agreement to take place, being that the amount of taxes paid is less than the assessed value there requires an amendment to the Municipal Government Act, therefore the county has brought this forward with a request that it be done by the Legislature, and we certainly will be respecting that request.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, very briefly - I didn't have the opportunity to speak on this bill on second reading - while the intent of the bill is one that we certainly support, we have been receiving some e-mails and correspondence from Nova Scotians who are a bit concerned with how the police will be handling the information that they would be able to access as a result of this piece of legislation. So I just want to put on the record that there is a bit of unease, especially from those concerned about privacy concerns - how the information will be shared, will it be shared with family members once the police have obtained it, and is there additional information regarding an individual not relevant to the fact they've been missing that will be shared as well?</p>

Mr. Speaker, Bill No. 94 is the legalization that deals with implementing new electoral boundaries for the Province of Nova Scotia.

To paraphrase his answer, it was I don't even believe it was an independent process. So if you have a commissioner saying that, how can any Nova Scotian have confidence that this was an independent process? (Applause)</p>

          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, I have to say I'm rather sad today, seeing this bill come before the House and seeing what's going to happen as a result of this bill. My understanding - and perhaps I was a little naive coming into the House in 2009 - was that setting the boundaries was supposed to be an open and transparent process. What ensued, what happened here, doesn't pass the smell test.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I rise for a few moments to join the debate on Bill No. 94. I have to say at the outset that this was a sad decision for democracy in Nova Scotia. The Leader of the Progressive Conservatives was quite right that all Opposition members are going to be voting against this bill. It started out as an independent commission and was politicized by the government to the point where they picked the ridings they wanted. The Minister of Justice got involved early in the process and started the process going of what turned out to be a political process and not an independent process, to let the commission do its work without interference from the government.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, it was interesting listening to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. I hope he goes back to reflect on his comments. He asked the question, how do you define an Acadian? Then he went on to criticize the Opposition Parties for not having representation of minorities, despite the fact that this caucus includes a member of Lebanese descent, a Ukrainian-Canadian, two Acadians. He said that the Liberal caucus hadn't nominated Black candidates. He should speak to the Premier and ask him who ran against him. I think Mr. Ince would be surprised to learn the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage does not consider him to be a Black Nova Scotian. (Applause)</p>

I have stood in my place in this House and have spoken a number of times on this bill and about the division that has been created by this bill, but I think it's important to go back to where we started, which was back in December of last year, December 2011, when we put together a group of select members of this House representing two members of our caucus, two members of the Progressive Conservative caucus, and five members of the governing Party, to kind of put together terms of reference that would guide the Nova Scotians who were chosen to represent us in the deliberations and how they engage Nova Scotians about what the electoral boundaries should look like.</p>

He doesn't have to apologize to me. He doesn't have to apologize to me at all. I would appreciate it if he would apologize to every minority in the Province of Nova Scotia and if he would apologize to every female member, not only of this House, but every woman in this province for his remarks. The fact that he would stand up the way he just did and not come clean to apologize is beyond me.</p>
