          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the NDP Government stooped to an all-time low. Former residents of the Home for Colored Children have come together. They provided painstaking evidence in their affidavits - evidence that was personal, hurtful, and painful. Evidence that for many was locked away in a bank of horrid memories for many, many years, only to come out now so we can get to the bottom and find the truth.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, nothing in the world could be further from the truth. The applications made yesterday before the Supreme Court were routine. They are a routine matter. The reality is that we are engaging in a process where we are putting together a panel to look at all of the circumstances surrounding the events around the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. We want to look at what the social mores of the day were, if they dictated how the people there were treated. We want to ensure that the stories of those people are heard, that the process is open, transparent, is honest.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as I already pointed out, these are routine applications. They happen all the time. The rules before the Supreme Court are that they have control over their own process. It has nothing to do with the question of how we go about dealing with the questions surrounding what happened at the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children. They have to do with the question of compensation.</p>

          <p>MR.

What went on in the courtroom yesterday on behalf of the NDP Government was an embarrassment for all Nova Scotia. There are no words to describe the steps and the extent to which this government will go to try to discredit victims and hide the truth.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday a team of government lawyers was sent in to demand that the courts throw out all or portions of 13 affidavits filed by former residents of the Nova Scotia Home for Colored Children in their attempts to be certified as a class to tell their story. This is an action that constitutional expert Dr. Wayne MacKay called extreme, and that well-known law firm Wagner and Associates called unprecedented. Now I ask the Premier, why is the Premier trying to silence the former residents on such an important matter, in such an extreme and unprecedented way?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I read the comments and I was at a loss to understand how they came to those conclusions because I think most people understand these applications are made every day. They are made in class action suits. They're made in all kinds of suits.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier cannot claim to be listening when he sends a team of lawyers in to stop 13 affidavits from being allowed to be heard in court. That is the opposite of listening. The Premier talked about forming his independent panel to create a process for healing a month ago. He said "They . . ." meaning the former residents, ". . . wanted one of reconciliation and one of healing. It is really about a community wanting to have some recognition of the things that happened in the past." Yet now they are being silenced in court by their own government. I will ask the Premier to explain why he says one thing in public and then sends his lawyers in to do the opposite in court.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, all Nova Scotians, the victims included, have the right to expect that the process of law will be carried out forthrightly, honestly, without prejudice, and that the applications of the rules will be exactly the same, regardless of who stands before them. In fact, it's one of the fundamental principles of law that people have the right to stand before an independent adjudicator and to hear the case. Both sides have that right to expect that they will be treated fairly, openly, and honestly.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure all members appreciate the lecture that they just received from the Premier. The fact of the matter is that the former residents also deserve to have a government that doesn't treat their claims in such an extreme and unprecedented manner, as has been described by constitutional experts like Wayne MacKay. They deserve to be treated fairly. They deserve to be heard. They don't deserve to be faced with a crushing team of lawyers intent on stopping them from telling their stories, the opposite of what the Premier told them and told the people of Nova Scotia when they came forward just a short time ago. That's the court process.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the court process is not about healing - it is about compensation and it is about examining individual claims, and that means examining evidence. You can't put evidence before the court and not expect that it's not going to be tested because that is, in fact, the exact purpose of the courts. That's why the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia looks at all these applications, as they should. They protect their own process, they protect the interests of the parties that stand before them. That is fundamental to our system of justice.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. I think Nova Scotians pretty well know that the Premier is tight with Nova Scotia Power and Emera; they know that he endorsed the Maritime Link deal before he even knew what the deal was. Now the Premier has signed agreements and deals to ensure the project and Emera's bottom line are secure without regard for the people of the province, and he has given guarantees to Emera that he will not negatively impact Emera with regulatory change - and I'll table his press release stating that.</p>

I mean, the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservatives like to pretend that there is some other project that mysteriously would emerge, but there isn't. The reality is that the Maritime Link is a project which will provide the lowest, fairest rates for Nova Scotians. It will do so and, in addition to having the lowest and fairest rates, it will also usher in a new era for renewable energy in the province.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I'll give him this: it takes a lot of temerity to stand up and say those kinds of things. The simple fact of the matter is that we inherited a colossal mess from the former government. It took years to try to fix it - a huge deficit, an economy that was faltering, and a slavish adherence to the worst kind of economic development initiatives. We changed all that. We moved, we turned a corner here in Nova Scotia, creating thousands of new jobs - 11,000 jobs associated with the shipyard contract that is just starting to get underway. We cemented in place jobs in Port Hawkesbury, in a place where the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party would have given up on the industry and those workers.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister responsible for the Fisheries Loan Board. Last year one of our prominent boat builders, Dixon's Marine Group, in the minister's home community of Woods Harbour, was unfairly treated by the loan board when one of its customers was told by loan board staff that they were overpricing their vessels and that the fishermen should look elsewhere. This came as a complete surprise to the shipyard as it strives to be competitive.</p>

STERLING BELLIVEAU : First of all we do not discuss personal files in the House of Assembly but I can tell you that the loan board, since I've been elected and since I took this position - when I entered politics in 2006, fishermen did not have access to capital for a loan for a licence. I ran on that campaign and I can tell you right now that fishermen have access to capital for licences and it has been much improved and I thank the member opposite for bringing that question to the floor.</p>

D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, what's even more interesting about this issue is that when Dixon's went to the loan board to find out what they were basing their pricing on, they were told that the information doesn't exist.

Dixon's Marine Group tells me in the end the loan was capped - the capped amount to lend to the fishers, causing those fishermen to dig even deeper into their pockets to the tune of almost $32,000 in both cases - there were two cases of this one. So when the industry is hurting, prices are at an all-time low, the rural economy is in recession, Mr. Speaker, the government stuck it to these fishermen.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, since this government took office, there has been a spike in unemployment for Cape Bretoners to the tune of 10 per cent. This makes 11,000 unemployed islanders at last count. Those 11,000 people are certainly not better off under this Premier, under this government. If the government's own employment projections are to be believed, there are more job losses on the horizon for the island and the island's economy. Will the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism explain why his government is content with its record of 11,000 unemployed Cape Bretoners?</p>

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, what we are not content with is the loss of federal jobs on Cape Breton Island. We're not content with the fact that Canada Post is closing. We're not content with Veterans Affairs closing their office, contact centres and the list goes on and on. What we are doing in Cape Breton Island is investing in businesses on Cape Breton Island. While we are creating jobs in Cape Breton, the federal government is eliminating jobs.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the CBRM and council have recently proposed a sound, five-year capital plan to address infrastructure concerns, put tradespeople back to work and bridge the gap to possibly improving economic conditions. As you know, things can't get much worse on the island. If the Minister of ERDT is truly commited to helping Cape Breton, will he signal his support by identifying the CBRM capital plan as a provincial priority and will he earmark funds for the capital plan in this fiscal year?</p>

Business confidence has dropped, and consumer confidence has dropped. The government estimates that the provincial employment will drop by 1,100 jobs in 2013.</p>

A large amount of people in the Preston riding rely on the construction industry for employment. Housing starts are down - one of the leading indicators of economic growth - and are being forecast to drop by 11.1 per cent in 2013 and again by 5 per cent in 2014. This forecast drop . . .</p>

Mr. Speaker, it's a known fact, and you would know this and other members of the House particularly from Cape Breton would know, that Whitney Pier has been a historic community within the City of Sydney for many, many years, going back to the turn of the last century when many immigrants from that area of Sydney came and established residence in the area of Whitney Pier to work at the Sydney steel plant - and other industries such as the coal mines but particularly the Sydney steel plant at the beginning of the 20th Century.</p>

I can say to you, Mr. Speaker, that - and I do appreciate the historic significance of the area of Whitney Pier but there are also other areas of the new riding of Sydney, the historic north end where Sydney was founded, as a unique community in itself. The historic community of the north end of Sydney has many buildings that are declared heritage properties because the founding of Sydney actually took place in the North End of Sydney, with the old St. George's Church being one of them and Jost House and all of the facilities, including the army barracks that were down there and now the entire operation for the army is still based in the North End.</p>

          <p>MR. ALLAN MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, I'm just going to speak very briefly on this piece of legislation. I want to put something on the record here from a constituent. I want to make the point, as I have in this Legislature many times before, about pensions and the importance of regulation of pensions. I know there are people in my area, the NewPage pensioners, whom we've certainly heard a lot about, whose hopes for retirement income were really dashed when they had to take big hits on their pensions. Yes, in part due to the state of the funds in their pensions at the time that NewPage went into creditor protection, but also because of changes that happened with their pensions, based on choices they made, based on information made available to them.</p>

The member for Richmond brought up a good point about people being in no- person's land, if you will, in the future if they're caught in a period between 65 and 67. I would be remiss if I didn't say that there was a time when we used the clinical rating system and it allowed all members - if you were in receipt of a WCB pension, that you could carry with you for life and it was the last Liberal Government that changed that, that went to wage loss and the pension stopped at 65.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I'm pleased to rise on this today. You know, the advantage to the intervening couple hours is that we've been able to speak to Emera, and also to review this misrepresentation - the inadvertent misrepresentation, I suspect - that the Premier made about Emera's comments in this article. I'll be able to go through that having looked into that.</p>

          <p>MR.

There seems to me at this moment to be a couple or three things, in particular, that we're speaking of. We're speaking of renewable, clean, green energy, we're speaking of power rates, and we're speaking of a number of 8 cents per kilowatt hour.</p>
