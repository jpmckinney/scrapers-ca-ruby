        <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : This falls under the category "if you say it enough times, you believe it" and that's what this is before us today, Mr. Speaker. It's just an assertion that they think they made up something, they agree on something, and keep saying it and saying it and it's just not fact. You know, the reality is they voted against the budget anyway, this has been fully canvassed whether it's through estimates, whether today in Public Accounts Committee when it was there. It's just another venue, if you will, of a tired Party with tired tricks. There is no prima facie case here and I would ask you to dismiss it summarily. Thank you.</p>

        <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I just wish to speak briefly on this matter of privilege that you are considering. I hear the Government House Leader describing the Liberal Party as a tired Party, and I'm not disputing that. I'm just glad they have finally have woken up to this issue because it has certainly been one we've been raising since last February.</p>

        <p>MR. SPEAKER : Thank you. I noticed in the honourable Leader of the Official Opposition's point of privilege there was additional information considered to the information that was sent to my office beforehand. But I will take the matter under advisement and I will report back to the House at my earliest convenience. Thank you.</p>

I want to begin by acknowledging that I, along with my caucus colleagues, understand the seriousness of the issue facing our young people. I recognize that in many cases these young people are caught in a web of social media.

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, in 2009, the Premier went to the doorsteps of families across this province, looked Nova Scotians in the eyes and told them, no tax increases, no program cuts, and we will balance the budget every year of our mandate. What Nova Scotians got were tax hikes - the Premier hiked the HST, increased over 1,400 user fees, and added the NDP energy tax to every power bill in the province. Now we learn that the Premier and his Finance Minister tabled a misleading budget so that the Premier could say that the NDP was on track.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this is a government that prides itself on the accomplishments set out in the Throne Speech. We took one of the most difficult economic recessionary times in our history and managed to not only get through that without massive labour disruptions - including getting us back into balance, having inherited a government that was on the road to a $1.4 billion deficit. We are turning the corner of this province to a brighter future for all our citizens.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, that's one long corner. It has been fully established by the Auditor General that the Finance Minister stood in his place and delivered a budget that he knew to be false. In March 2012, the Finance Department had the updated revenue estimates, and had run them through their economic models. In an article published in the ChronicleHerald on February 8, 2013, the Auditor General said, "They had the later numbers, and they ran on them. And that's why we said, 'Well, why wouldn't you use them? . . .You have to use the more current information because you have it.'"</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General's Report clearly shows that the 2012-13 budget contained a known error of $27 million. It could have been corrected and it wasn't; they could have told us about it and they didn't. I ask the Premier, why did he allow a false budget to be presented to the people of Nova Scotia?</p>

The method for determining the estimates of the budget in the previous year was exactly the same way as it has always been done before.

Last year the Premier produced a budget that deliberately overstated the estimates by $27 million of revenue. A shortfall of $27 million means less money for government programs and calls into question the assertion of the Premier that the NDP is on track, and calls into question the estimates and assumptions used for the upcoming budget.</p>

They told Nova Scotians in no uncertain terms that there would be no tax increases, no cuts to programs, and balanced budgets every year. Well, that was then.</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, that is an interesting answer given that while they took off the HST with one hand from home heating fuel they allowed Nova Scotia Power to increase the rates 30 per cent from three years ago. We know that there were 1,400 user fees hiked two years ago under the NDP Government, and this is the very same NDP Government that called fee increases across-the-board tax hikes, and that was when they were in Opposition. But just like the promises to not increase taxes, the NDP has no trouble saying one thing and doing quite another. My question to the Minister of Finance is, can the minister tell Nova Scotians if she will be hiking fees for the coming fiscal year?</p>

The NDP have lost the trust of Nova Scotians; with each broken promise they have chipped away at their own credibility.

          <from>MS. DIANA WHALEN</from>
          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. For the months leading up to this Spring sitting of the Legislature, the Finance Minister went around the province lowering expectations for a balanced budget. She refused to say whether she'd be able to balance the budget, and she dodged the question on the matter. This time last year the former Finance Minister was telling Nova Scotians that the deficit was $27 million less than it actually was, and in the first budget that the NDP brought in they resorted to distorting the budget by making a huge prepayment to universities - a practice they had previously condemned when in Opposition.</p>

How is she going to overcome that $300 million? How can she convince Nova Scotians that this has been done without cuts to programs, without increased taxes, without the usual tools that you would have to do such a thing?

I do understand the frustrations from the mom, because when you have a child that has an issue, you love that child.

This government has been in favour of the deal presented by Emera for Muskrat Falls since before they knew what the deal was - before they knew what would be in the deal, and before they knew what the costs were. In fact, despite this splashy roadshow they've just gone on, they still can't answer basic questions that people have - which, frankly, since the Premier and Energy Minister have said this project is so cost beneficial to Nova Scotia, they should have right on the tips of their tongues.</p>

And the member mentioned a quote from Quebec - and I want to, maybe, bring up a quote as well. The Leader of the Liberal Party had this to say, in Hansard, about a year ago, March 30th, he said, ". . . that the Lower Churchill Falls is an important project that I believe will allow us to move towards a more renewable, sustainable energy market in Atlantic Canada." Yet, just a few months later, he had this to say about the Lower Churchill - he said it's a bad deal. So I'm trying to figure out why they're flip-flopping around here in two different directions.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : You know, Mr. Speaker, the position of the Liberal caucus has been quite clear, and unfortunately nobody else in Nova Scotia has had a problem identifying it. We think Muskrat Falls has potential. The deal that this government has signed onto lacks answers, and this government doesn't have them. And let's be clear - we are not the only ones. The Premier received a letter recently, which I will table, which asked the minister to give the Utility and Review Board more time; the consumer advocate wrote a letter to the Premier asking that the Utility and Review Board be given more time, because the answers are not available; the small business advocate wrote a letter - and I'll table that - to the Premier, asking for more time; and the Canadian Wind Energy Association has also criticized this government.</p>

We had regulations out last summer that everybody had an opportunity to comment on. Not a comment from the Liberal Party about those regulations - and now I hear that they want more time. I understand that a lot of that information that is available has been previous documents and reports that have always been available to them, and we feel strongly that half a year is sufficient time - and the URB, if they want more time, they'll come to us. But really, half a year is sufficient time.</p>

It's the best option on the environmental front as far as reducing our greenhouse gas targets and meeting the federal coal regulations. I know the URB will look at all the evidence and test that, and interveners will question it and determine what is right for ratepayers. The rate of return is also part of that.

We've had the opportunity to go around the province over the last number of weeks and engage with Nova Scotians in our energy tour. In fact we had over 500 Nova Scotians who came out to our various meetings from Yarmouth to Sydney. They're able to talk about our energy plan. It includes Muskrat Falls but it includes diversification into wind power and tidal power and sustainable biomass and natural gas and native hydroelectricity as well as what we're importing from Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, the numbers related to the CBRM are alarming, and have led to the development of a long-term plan for addressing our many challenges. Sydney is the only city in Atlantic Canada with double-digit unemployment. The CBRM unemployment rate itself sits at 17.5 per cent, and even higher in some Cape Breton communities. The CBRM owns 20 per cent of all required wastewater upgrades in Atlantic Canada, a whopping $454 million. With aging infrastructure and shrinking revenues, our municipality needs an innovative path to develop assets and keep our communities sustainable.</p>

Of course, there will be infrastructure spending in the province over the next number of years, and Sydney would be included in that kind of budgeting. Cape Breton would be included in that kind of budget.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I guess that would be five boards that are receiving budget cuts - so for the minister I will clarify it as five. The Nova Scotia Teachers Union states that 700 teachers have already been cut from the system. Students are losing their education assistants and boards are being forced to choose between paying for power or providing educational programming and much-needed supports.</p>

With the target numbers that I was able to provide to our school boards, a couple of weeks ago when I met with them, we recognize that there is a 3 per cent increase per student investment for our children in this province. Our budget has increased and we are making sure that our school boards that have seen significant decline are protected.</p>

But I will say that under the target budget numbers that we gave out a couple of weeks ago we recognize that we need a few more people in our system to serve the needs of our students, so there will be more psychologists and speech pathologists hired in the coming year.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, for the minister's information and all others here - that information was requested of school boards, it was submitted by school boards, the department has it - and I will table it for all of the boards. It comes to approximately 2,000 students who are on the wait-list for speech-language and school psychologists, I would encourage the minister to look at it, and it was submitted in June. Was the minister aware of these wait-lists when she announced further cuts to public education?</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Mr. Speaker, I guess my question to the minister - that information was available, it was in the minister's hands. It should have been used when the minister was preparing budgets. With five boards getting funding cuts, with wait-lists of over 2,000 students to be assessed by speech-language psychologists, it would seem that the announcement a few months ago that the minister once again is looking to balance the books on the backs of the kids of this province.</p>

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : Mr. Speaker, my question this afternoon is for the Minister of Health and Wellness. Paramedics have been engaged in negotiations for some time. In late February we learned that paramedics voted 98 per cent in favour of rejecting their employer's offer. That was with 95 per cent coming out of the membership. The government and paramedics are reportedly far apart.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member. We all want to know that our paramedics are there, ready to respond in emergencies across the province. No one - I know the member opposite and definitely myself - wants to see a strike. That's why we're continuing to encourage both sides to work through the collective bargaining unit process. We don't want to see a work disruption and I'm very confident that the two sides will work extremely hard to avoid that.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister as well for that answer. I know I'm certain that he does not want to see that group on the street by way of a strike. The fact that 98 per cent of paramedics came out was quite significant and they could be off the job as soon as April 12th.</p>

Again, I'm sure that having been part of that in 1999, he nor I nor anyone else in Nova Scotia wants to see that happen again in this province. Paramedics play a big role in providing overnight care, as an example, at CECs when no physician is present. This is what the NDP did when it broke its promise, though, to keep the ERs, like Cobequid Centre, open. We put these paramedics in place and they are a valuable asset in their communities where they're at.</p>

There is over $80 million in owed, court-ordered payments not going to women and children across the province. Given the loss of 24 experienced staff people, with some enforcement officers already with caseloads of over 700 cases, can the Minister of Justice tell us what impact closing five offices, moving these offices, opening a new office, hiring a new workforce and training a new workforce will have on the families who are owed over $80 million?</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, I really value that question because it certainly outlines the difference between us, as a government, and the Opposition. The Opposition believes in just spending more money, continuing to do the same thing over and over again, without making any changes or improvements. Their philosophy is, if it didn't work 10 years ago let's put more money into it and let's see if it will change. Our belief is, let's be more creative, let's invest in people in Cape Breton. We know the talent is there, we know the intellectual wealth is there and we're going to enrich that area by putting people in the neighbourhood.</p>

In fact, a lot of engineers will come from their existing companies and simply move over for the higher salaries that PROJEX can pay.

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : You know, about the only thing that the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville said that was correct is that many of the NDP members are almost at the end of the line, and they won't be here in a few months. He might be one of them.</p>

          <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. And I do get a kick on Opposition Days when we do have the opportunity to speak to government resolutions. They are entertaining at the best of times. I know full well that I'm probably not going to take up my full time on this one, because I don't want to give too much credence to what the member for Hammonds Plains-Upper Sackville was talking about.</p>
