          <p>MR. LLOYD HINES : Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct the Assembly's attention to the east gallery and introduce Councillor Fin Armsworthy who is with the Municipality of the District of Guysborough, formerly with the Town of Canso where he served for 14 years. I must say he has made a seamless transition onto the new council and has served the municipality as well as he had done for his former municipality. I would ask the Assembly to welcome him here today. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MS. DIANA WHALEN : It's my pleasure to rise today to continue my reply to the Budget Speech that we heard yesterday here in the House. Just before beginning I would like to recognize, as well, the guests in the gallery that you mentioned, Mr. Speaker, and say that had I realized tomorrow was Tartan Day I would have worn some tartan today. I think you don't have to go very far in the history of most Nova Scotians to find somebody with a Scottish name. My mother was an Urquhart and her family, of course, was from Scotland originally in the 1800s. They had moved, actually, to St. Peter's area in West Bay in Cape Breton in the early 1800s, so we take great pride in that. I know that there are many people in this House who have names that are definitely identified as Scottish but we don't have to go many generations back to recognize that we are not far from our roots in this province. So I do think it is nice to have them here with us today. (Applause)</p>

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I was speaking to the Auditor General's opinion that he presents each year along with the budget and I do agree that in past years it was qualified, even under the first few years of the NDP. It was qualified because all of the corporations and DHAs, and so on, were not properly consolidated with the main budget and that has been done this year. That's the main reason there is no qualification on the revenue estimates. It's so that all of the bake sales and all of the money that comes in separately through school boards is all recognized in the budget. That's the reason.</p>

The small business rate was lowered by half a percentage point, down to 3 per cent, but what the minister never told the business community, when she had the opportunity in front of a business crowd in Halifax, was that she changed the threshold, as well, the government chose to change the threshold at which you no longer had 3 per cent income tax for small business. But you pay 16 per cent for corporate tax, so even the large corporations are going to be hit earlier, because their first amount had been at the lower rate.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I just want to begin by saying that I really appreciate the remarks of the speaker who just concluded, the Finance Critic for the Liberal Party. I believe she did a very thorough job of discrediting the claim of balance in her normal professional manner. I know she has some background in these things, and I just want to compliment her on a job well done here this morning. It's good to see someone in Opposition who does have a grasp of the finances of the province.</p>

I say that because I know that she would have made very different decisions about that trust fund if she was in a position to make those decisions, based on her own professionalism which is on display in this House every day. And that is sad to say, but I know it's true.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Premier. In 2003, the Progressive Conservative Government of the day appointed a former chief of staff from federal PC Cabinet Minister Kim Campbell's office to the position of Director of Corporate Communications for the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation. At that time, I'd like to table an article quoting the member for Preston-Dartmouth - now the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture - who told the Daily News that the person responsible for this hiring should quit or be fired for such a blatant act of patronage.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the honourable member for the question. What this government did was hire a qualified person to fill a vacancy that was left vacant by a 30-year person who decided to retire. In this province all protocol jobs - those associated to the Lieutenant Governor's position and those associated here - have been hires that have been made by the government.</p>

          <p>MS. MACDONALD : Well I know why the Leader of the government, the Premier, is attempting to deflect from being accountable for the patronage appointment he just made - he thinks this isn't an important issue. He told reporters moments ago in the scrum that people on Main Street don't care about patronage in Nova Scotia, and in fact he's had very few emails on this, or phone calls. Perhaps the Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister was one of those people who contacted him. Given that the member from Preston-Dartmouth, back in 2003, on the Tory patronage appointment also had this to say about that appointment, and I quote from the Daily News, "This begs the question: what else is going on?"</p>

Mr. Speaker, with every contract that has been signed by this premier, there is no buyout clause in any of them and all can be terminated by any future government at any time, unlike the NDP, who were in power just a few short months ago, and what did they do in the secrecy of the cabinet room, in the dying days? They bumped up severances that were already generous for their political friends. Not only did we turf the NDP Government but we got a bill for severances for a million dollars to look after.</p>

I want to also remind all members of this House, in case they haven't heard me, there is no buyout at the end of this contract - and just to help clarify what the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party actually did, he left in that buyout clause just in case he got fired from that position; that buyout clause of $124,000 was there so that if the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party got turfed from his job he had a soft landing.</p>

          <p>MR. LARRY HARRISON : Mr. Speaker, this is a question to the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. The Bluenose II has always been - well, it has been in a position of pride for a good many years for Nova Scotians. In a recent question and answer, the minister said that he hasn't had the time yet to go and see this project. This project eats up half of the funding assets of the department.</p>

What I will say is that this project is very near and dear to Nova Scotians' hearts and to my heart. It is a project that is going through dock trials right now and once those dock trials end and sea trials are completed, I will be one of the first people there to be on that boat and enjoy it.</p>

          <p>MR. GORDIE GOSSE : Mr. Speaker, on November 8th the federal Citizenship and Immigration Minister made big changes to one of Canada's most popular immigration programs, the Canadian Experience Class, what they call the CEC. These changes are bad news for potential immigrants to Nova Scotia, so my question to the minister is, could she provide details about the conversation between she and her federal counterpart after she called Ottawa to express her frustration over these short-sighted changes?</p>

But what is most troubling about these changes were the new qualifications regarding who will be excluded from the program. Effective November 9th, experience in certain jobs will no longer qualify an applicant for the CEC; jobs like cooks, bookkeepers, food service, and retail managers, and others.</p>

          <p>HON. PAT DUNN : Mr. Speaker, this question through you is for the Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. This month the Canadian Federation of Independent Business produced a report on the state of apprenticeship in Nova Scotia. I wish I could say it was a positive report, and I'll table that. Instead, it confirmed many of our concerns. We are on track to face a serious labour crisis with high out-migration, low immigration, and an aging population. Things need to change. Young Nova Scotians are looking for leadership to make needed changes to apprenticeships. This is clearly an issue that cannot wait. My question to the minister, how much longer will small businesses have to suffer until changes are made to apprenticeships?</p>

          <p>HON. KELLY REGAN : I would like to welcome the member back to the House after his involuntary sabbatical. The member is correct that there are concerns around the current apprenticeship regime in this province. For example, our apprentices are starting their apprenticeships two years older than the average across the country, and they take longer to actually finish their apprenticeship - about two years longer as well. We do have a problem there with our apprentices. Nova Scotia businesses need workers and our skilled workers need experience. One of the things that we've discovered is that during a slowdown, we have workers who are not completing their apprenticeship because there is no work for them. We are actually working with the community college, with business, and we expect to have a new plan very soon. Thank you.</p>

          <p>MR. DUNN : Mr. Speaker, after those kind words I feel like taking a second and third question with me and putting it aside. However, I will continue. The Liberal platform suggests that there would be changes to the apprenticeship program in the current year. Nearly half of all small business owners point to apprenticeships as potential solutions to the labour shortage. They are facing many roadblocks including high costs, poaching risks, information deficiencies, inflexible training arrangements, and provincial inconsistencies across the country. This long list of barriers makes it difficult, if not impossible, for many employers to hire and train apprentices. My question to the minister is, when can small businesses expect some relief?</p>

We're getting calls about the Heating Assistance Rebate Program, and I'm sure the minister's office is also.

We'll continue with that cap at the present time. We'll continue to monitor it and depending on the upload, we may, in the future, be able to adjust that cap.</p>

The inconsistencies can put people at risk.

This is an incredibly important task, and indeed no small job. I know that the minister is up to the task, because she has been watching the province's finances for quite some time. In fact, last April, while in Opposition, the minister expressed a lot of concern over the NDP's budget. Many Nova Scotians shared the minister's concern about the budget. Many Nova Scotians questioned whether it was actually balanced or not, and they are now anxious to see how the actual results are comparing to the expectations of the budget.</p>

This is something that I know is important to all Nova Scotians, to see what the state of the finances is. We are waiting right now for a little bit more information. As the members will know, we've received new information on the economy - the growth or, in some cases, the negative growth in the economy. Some of the difficulties have been the outflow of people, a decline in population, and a higher unemployment. In the Finance Department we take all of that information to make our forecasts and to see where we're at during the year. Right now we're waiting on one further piece of information on HST.</p>

We hear numbers like $14 billion in debt, depreciating infrastructure, 11,000 fewer jobs as compared to four years ago. In fact, we hear those numbers so much that they may start to lose their impact on some of us, but of course, not on me with my fascination for numbers.

          <p>MS. WHALEN : Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the question, again. This issue won't arise in the update because that was something that happened in the budget. It was a payment made by the NDP Government at the time to load extra money into the previous year's deficit in order to show what they called a balanced budget for this current year. My fiscal update will show where we are this year going forward and how it's unfolding. As I said, I have some real concerns about the revenue estimates.</p>

          <from>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU</from>
          <p>HON. STERLING BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday was dumping day for our lobster fishers in fishing areas 33 and 34, and if the catch in fishing area 35 is any indication, they can expect another bountiful harvest this year. Unfortunately, as fishers know far too well, large harvests may bring down the prices. My question to the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture is, now that the new CETA agreement has been signed, what steps is this new government taking to increase demand for Nova Scotia lobster in the European market?</p>

          <p>HON. KEITH COLWELL : Mr. Speaker, this is a very important topic that the former Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture brings up. It's very important that we move forward in marketing our product as a quality product from Canada, and we're in the process of working out an arrangement with the other provinces, as the member would know. To achieve that, there's going to be a long, difficult road. There are many issues that have to be addressed that have been outstanding for more than four years.</p>

          <p>MR. BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for his answer. I don't know if he managed to get down to the wharf on dumping day, but in case he didn't, I can tell you that in southwestern Nova Scotia, the temperature was low but the enthusiasm was high. My question to the minister is - it has been demonstrated over and over again that MSC certification is extremely important to the European consumer. In May of this year, my NDP Government committed to funding MSC certification for the Nova Scotia lobster industry. Can the minister provide an update on how the certification process is currently going on and will he commit to that financial commitment that we did previously?</p>

          <p>MR. BELLIVEAU : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for his answer. MSC certification is not a quick or inexperienced process. It will likely take several years before Nova Scotia lobsters receive certification. My final question, given the significance of MSC, will the minister . . .</p>

DENISE PETERSON-RAFUSE : It is an honour to speak about this bill today introduced by the government, An Act to Ensure Accountability in Providing Economic Development Assistance in Nova Scotia. I do understand that the minister feels a need to continue to play the political perception game by presenting this bill. This bill has little substance. It is to make it look like something is being done, when actually it is just to divert the attention from the fact that while they stood on this side of the House they were very clear that they were not going to give any money to corporations.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that during the election the words that were being used were "trust," "change," and "first for Nova Scotia." Those were not our words. Those were the words of the Liberal Party. Those are the words that Nova Scotians are carrying with them each and every day, because of the fact that they did go to the polls, and they made their decision. They made their decision based on the words that they heard, and they made their decisions on belief, believing that this Party was going to come forth with change and be able, as they said, to trust them. How do you trust a newly-elected government that flip-flops immediately?</p>

I know we're hearing some murmurs from the backbenchers over there that they're only going to end the bailouts for certain types of corporations or certain types of situations.

I agree that Lower Churchill will give us stable rates, and that's what we've said since the get-go, Mr. Speaker. It's needed. It has to be a very serious, viable piece of our energy portfolio. We agree with that, Mr. Speaker. But the fact is that one thing that all Parties should be able to agree to in this House, from having rotated from the government side and this can go back for many, many years, is there's no simple fix when it comes to your energy costs and your needs. If someone could merely click their heels and have rates drop, there's not a government, there's not a member in here, who wouldn't agree with being able to do that. It's just common sense and a lot of times this Chamber is devoid of that but I think that even we could reach that bar, Mr. Speaker. That's the reality of it.</p>

Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians want their workplaces to be safe, and they're eager to assist in making them so. Workplace safety fines are part of making this happen, but they need to be consistent and they need to be fair. We know employers and employees want the administrative penalty system to focus on serious and repeat offenders, and for education to be an important part of the process. During consultations, two of the biggest concerns that were noted were how the funds were spent and how penalties are appealed. We listened and we're making these changes to protect workers and keep workplaces safe.</p>

          <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the minister for bringing this forward. We will be supporting the bill. I don't know what's new in it in some ways, but anything that inches even worker safety forward we would support. There are some issues when it comes to the idea of getting more inspectors and the fines and so on because this is more from words, I would hope, of caution than of criticism. I would hate to see inspectors turn out to be ticket writers as opposed to people who really help with workplace safety. They are the front line for working men and women in this province, to keep them safe.</p>

I did want to update some of the members on some of the points they raised. We continue to work towards having a prosecutor in place. Of course the Public Prosecution Service is arm's length from government, so while we can move things towards getting a prosecutor, it will not be a prosecutor from the Department of Labour and Advanced Education, it is the Public Prosecution Service that actually has the prosecutor but we are close, I believe, to having that in place.</p>

I don't like when I see the deer, though, on top of the trucks because my dad used to hunt and when I originally went out with my husband, he used to hunt.
