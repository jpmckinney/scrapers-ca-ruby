        <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
        <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, on a point of privilege. Once again, this morning, we witnessed an example of this majority NDP Government ignoring the rules and traditions of this House. This morning at the Law Amendments Committee the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage sat as a voting member of the committee examining Bill No. 94, the House of Assembly Act, dealing with the new proposed electoral boundaries for Nova Scotia.</p>

        <p>HON. FRANK CORBETT : You know, Mr. Speaker, when government tries to do business here and it is held up by frivolous motions like this one, we clearly in the past - he even mentioned that ministers have sat on that and, indeed, that Party argued to have their Leader on committees, but when it fits them, they want to mold the rules to their order.</p>

        <p>HON. CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, of course, when somebody stands up on a point of privilege, it is one that should be taken seriously and for the wording that was brought forward, I think the member for Richmond stated the case very appropriately. The concern that we saw this morning when the Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage was seen to be on that committee, wondering how that all worked out - it seemed it had been the previous practice of this House that when someone got a promotion, somebody else was able to take the position from within that caucus.</p>

        <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
        <p>MR. SAMSON : Let me, Mr. Speaker, on the point of being told by the Government House Leader that this is a frivolous point of privilege. Ironically, on the point I raised, the matter of the former ruling by the Speaker at the time, Murray Scott - I just want to point out that at that time that ruling was the basis of a point of privilege raised by myself and former Opposition House Leader John Holm of the NDP when we stood together to uphold the rights of all members of this House. Nobody from the NDP thought it was frivolous back then.</p>

          <p>HON. PERCY PARIS : Mr. Speaker, DSTN in Trenton, Nova Scotia - we took a facility that was lying idle for a number of years, it was a building that was in ruin, and we negotiated with a foreign company to come in there and rejuvenate not only the building but the entire area. We partnered with our federal government to create jobs in DSTN.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, hardworking Nova Scotia entrepreneurs deserve respect from this government and not the competition that is going to be driven by their own tax dollars. Not only does this government-owned business plan on competing against Nova Scotia companies in the oil and gas industry, it also plans to compete as a shipbuilding supplier. We all remember Daewoo competing against Irving for the ships contracts, but they lost. Now through DSME and with the government's help, Daewoo is trying to get a piece of Nova Scotia's shipbuilding pie by competing against other private Nova Scotia companies.</p>

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, first of all I will say what is fair from my perspective. First of all, DSTN is not government-owned and I daresay that if the Leader of the Official Opposition, if they had their way, DSTN would not even be there because they would be facing 30 per cent to 50 per cent power hikes in the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, one thing for certain - if this Party were in power, private sector enterprise wouldn't have to worry about the government going into business against them. This deal is a prime example of why this government's big deals, with big business, cannot and will not grow the economy. We have a government that put $60 million into DSME and now the government is preparing to take this business and compete against private Nova Scotia entrepreneurs.</p>

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, I'm amazed, but I'm not going to say I'm surprised at the Leader of the Official Opposition trying to make some political gain out of things that aren't fact. The fact of the matter is this government has created jobs to the tune of 7,600 jobs, since we've come into power, not like that lot over there who, when they were in power, along with the Progressive Conservatives, led this province for 20 years to last place in the country.</p>

          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism as well. In 2010 the NDP bought 40 per cent of DSME for $19.6 million and loaned them another $40 million on top, some of it forgivable. They said that would create 500 jobs by now, but as the minister admitted in this House the other day, there are now fewer than 60 people working there. I will table that for the benefit of the House - that is $1 million per job. The minister's answer now is that that company should diversify, as he said in this House yesterday, and look to the Irving contract for more business. My question to the minister is, can any company that has been bailed out by the NDP now go into any business that they want or just ones that are owned by the NDP?</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, yes, we live in a democracy, but we also live in a system where private business gets first crack at these things, not government-owned enterprises. That is where the minister and those of us on this side of the House disagree. He owns half the company. Government-owned businesses don't work - just look at the Liberals and Petro-Canada, a company that had to be returned to the private sector because it couldn't compete. Now the NDP have to learn that lesson all over again, at Nova Scotians' expense.</p>

We've created a situation at the old TrentonWorks plant that we have confidence in, that it will be successful.

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : The same news story featured the Energy Minister saying about DSME: "It feels it can break into the Ontario market . . ." Ontario and Quebec, Mr. Speaker, two of the largest domestic markets for DSME's originally intended product, were largely shut off to DSME because those governments required a certain percentage of local content in their wind turbines. Both of these provinces legislated such requirements before the DSME investment was announced. My question for the Energy Minister is, why did this government invest $60 million into an operation with such limited access to domestic markets?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the reality is that it looks like not only will this be cost-neutral, it will be of some benefit to the province because of the administrative savings that will take place because we put together the Departments of Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Fisheries and Aquaculture in one compound and that is going to be beneficial to the province. These are good jobs that are going into rural communities, going into Cornwallis. The lease itself is with a community development association, so not one penny of it goes into the pockets of a private developer; it all goes into a community organization and is invested back into the community. I know that is something really hard for the Leader of the Third Party to understand, but that, of course, is a good deal for Nova Scotians.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, this is a new policy that we've now heard from the government, that they'll only look at space if it's not owned by a private developer. That's quite an admission by the Premier here today. The fact remains, he still won't know and no Nova Scotians will know if they got a good deal if they don't actually bother to tender for the space. If a non-profit is the best price they'll win in a tender like anybody else would - that is the point. Hopefully, when they buy a new photocopier today they'll tender for that so they can get the documents out on deadline and not blame the photocopier equipment, like they did today.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what was undertaken by the provincial civil service with respect to the leasing opportunities in Cornwallis is, in fact, the standard policy of the government, one that was followed by the previous government on numerous occasions. If you are using community development associations, there is not a tender process.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, the Premier is going to give this House, and I suppose all Nova Scotians, a long explanation about why he didn't at least tender for that space, so we would know if they are getting a good deal or not. What we do know is that they are paying more for office space in Cornwallis than for the same space in downtown Halifax. Nova Scotians know that on the face of it, that doesn't make sense. Only a tender would tell us whether that is a good deal or not.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, it's ironic to hear the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party complain about giving an explanation but the simple fact of the matter is that these benefits are two-fold. One, it supports a community development organization that does great work in Cornwallis. None of the value of this lease goes to a private developer - and it's not that we have any problem with the private developers but there are specific advantages to community development associations &#x2013; in this case every cent of it gets invested back into the community.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. On October 31st the minister rose in this House and said, "This government is making strategic investments to create good jobs and grow Nova Scotia's economy." Great work with DSME, by the way. Yet the latest Statistics Canada data shows we've lost 3,400 full-time jobs since the government took office in June, 2009. Those jobs were replaced by part-time jobs. My question to the minister, does this minister believe a part-time job is a good job, as he previously suggested, and that an economy can grow with such massive increases in part-time employment?</p>

Here are the good things the Premier referred to: massive increases in part-time employment, we have the second lowest wages in Canada, and there are more Nova Scotians unemployed now than in December 2008, during the recession.

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, as I have gotten on my feet time and time again and I've said that since we came into power, we've created 7,600 jobs in the Province of Nova Scotia. We work very closely with the Department of Labour and Advanced Education. The Department of Labour and Advanced Education have been, and always will be, part of any transition team that moves forward with respect to displaced workers.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, in his message in that document I tabled, the minister boasts several times of the groundwork he has done to support economic opportunities in the province. He concludes by saying, "Today more than ever, I am confident in what the future holds for Nova Scotia." I know 135 families who don't share his confidence and who are afraid of what the future holds for them in Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. PARIS : Mr. Speaker, as I've already said, through this government there is a transition team in place that not only involves Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, but obviously Labour and Advanced Education is playing a very key and vital role. We have people on the ground. We have the RDA that's there that I've already been in touch with. He sent me some information. They are meeting with the families and with the individuals.</p>

          <from>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT</from>
          <p>MR. HAROLD THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. The idea to move the Department of Natural Resources office in Digby to the new proposed DFO office in Cornwallis may have a negative effect on the delivery of services in that area. This decision seems to have been made quickly, with no input from anyone from the Municipality of Digby.</p>

          <from>HON. CHARLIE PARKER</from>
          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER : Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the honourable member for the question. We consulted widely in the community. There were meetings held with the warden with the Municipality of Digby and the warden with the Municipality of Clare, and also the mayor of the Town of Digby. We had discussions with those folks.</p>

          <from>MR. THERIAULT</from>
          <p>MR. THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, I want to table a memo from the Municipality of Digby which outlines several concerns about the DNR move to Cornwallis, and I want to give one quote from it: "Areas of immediate concern include increased fire response time, extra costs to deliver essential regional services such as parks maintenance . . . and the negative impact of access to DNR staff by Digby County residents."</p>

          <from>MR. PARKER</from>
          <p>MR. PARKER : Again, as I mentioned, we did consult widely with wardens and the mayor of the Town of Digby, but in actual fact there is a cost saving here because the DNR facility in Hillgrove is more than 50 years old. It needs a lot of repair, a lot of maintenance - somewhere in the area of $0.75 million just to repair it, and probably about $1.6 million to replace. By moving into one facility in Cornwallis, there is a cost saving and many benefits to all three departments and to the people of the area.</p>

          <p>MR. THERIAULT : Mr. Speaker, I'll also table a letter from the municipality, and I want to read one quote out of that: "To our understanding the only rationale for considering the relocation is to assist the business case of the April 30, 2012 decision to move Provincial Fisheries staff to the Digby/Annapolis area."</p>

          <from>MR. PARKER</from>
          <p>MR. PARKER : There are many cost savings to moving this Department of Natural Resources to Cornwallis, and the distance in time is very little. I understand it's about three minutes in the difference between Hillgrove and Cornwallis, so it's almost insignificant in that regard. The fire service will be about equally serviced as well, so there is very little difference. Plus it's going to save that $1.6 million capital investment, and it provides efficiencies of all three departments working closely together.</p>

What they need from the minister is a commitment to adequately support programs and services for students with special needs.

More students with more needs are being identified and funding to meet those needs is simply not there.</p>

He used the word "messy" and I would also agree with that word, but he also tried to characterize it as something the government had interfered with, and I reject that. (Interruptions)</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Madam Speaker, I'd like to take the opportunity to maybe bring us back to reality from some of the fantasyland that we were just brought into because I was a member of the select committee. I don't believe the member for Halifax Chebucto, who just spoke, was. Therefore, for him to say he's not aware, then maybe he should look exactly at the transcripts of the select committee. But that might be a challenge because right now the government is refusing to release the transcripts.</p>
