          <p>MR. SPEAKER : As the Speaker, I am tabling the Nova Scotia MLA Pension Review Report, dated November 3, 2011. I am having the Pages distribute the report to any members who would like a printed copy. The entire report is available on-line so if any members don't really need one of these printed copies, you could just tell the Pages. We printed a very limited number of copies to keep the cost down.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Yesterday the Premier said that first contract arbitration did not result in mass unionization - Statistics Canada's data shows that the Premier is simply wrong. Since 1997 the construction industry in Newfoundland and Labrador saw a 122 per cent increase; in Quebec the construction industry saw a 129 per cent increase; and in Saskatchewan forestry, fishing, and mining saw a 145 per cent increase.</p>

          <from>HON. DARRELL DEXTER</from>
          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Well, Mr. Speaker, people are entitled to unionize because they make that decision; it's a democratic right under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as you know. It is part of the freedom of choice that people have. That, in and of itself, has no relationship to first contract arbitration.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, first contract arbitration flies in the face of collective bargaining and common sense. Settlement tools for unions and employers already exist in this province. The Province of Nova Scotia has stable labour relations, but by forcing this legislation through, that may be in jeopardy. My question to the Premier is, why is his government pushing legislation through that is not necessary?</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. These are the words of the Premier : I don't really make much of anything of it. It's what he said yesterday when asked about the concerns of Nova Scotia employer groups and their worries about first contract arbitration. Now we learn that two weeks ago he also met with Michelin, a large non-unionized employer in our province, where 3,500 Nova Scotians work. They told him that first contract arbitration would put a chill on the investment climate in this province and that they would consider holding back on future investment if he went forward with his plan. This is proof that first contract arbitration is a job killer. So my question to the Premier is, does he also make nothing of the concerns of Michelin, an employer of 3,500 people in our province?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : He says that's not true. I don't recall, and I was told by them that I was the only one. Of course we look forward to any future investments in Michelin, and further, they know perfectly well that if we can further support the expansion of well-paying jobs in this province we will do so.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, we all know the problems with NewPage in the Strait area. We all know the problems with Bowater down in Queens. Some have argued that those issues are a result of global forces, the recession, declines in markets, and so on. But the concerns of Michelin and the concerns of all those employers who are worried about first-contract arbitration, they lie squarely on the Premier's shoulders. No one else can be blamed for their worries. So my question for the Premier is, why is he so determined to forge ahead with first contract arbitration when Michelin and their 3,500 families and all of those other employers tell them it is a bad idea?</p>

NewPage Port Hawkesbury, Bowater Mersey, and Minas Basin Pulp and Power have all shut down indefinitely or signalled layoffs are expected.

Last year, Nova Scotia Power took $121.5 million out of the Province of Nova Scotia and handed it to Emera to invest all over the globe. Under the Premier's advice to Nova Scotia Power, the rate of return has been reduced. But guess what? They're going to take $122 million out of the Province of Nova Scotia, which actually is an increase out of the rate base in this province to invest globally - across the globe, not here in Nova Scotia.</p>

I went and asked questions of the president of Nova Scotia Power at the hearing and I asked him to present to Nova Scotians the executive compensation package for his executive. They were unwilling to do that but they boasted about the fact that they've reduced the number of executives from 12 to eight. I said to him, how did that affect the compensation package? He said it didn't. So you mean to tell me we have four fewer executives or we're just dividing the pie up amongst eight people instead of 12? How is that to the benefit of Nova Scotians?

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, last night 115 retired managers from the now-closed NewPage mill in Point Tupper, Richmond County, met to discuss their financial future, namely their lack of legal representation when it comes to protecting their pensions with the current court case that is taking place. These 200 retirees and 100 existing workers make up NewPage's salaried, non-union, pension plan members.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what we're doing is keeping that asset in a "hot idle" position so that it can be sold and ultimately the best disposition for all the pensioners is to have an operating asset at NewPage, in Port Hawkesbury.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, as the Premier would be aware, the four pension plans at the NewPage facility have a potential wind-up deficit of $130.4 million, which would mean a significant reduction in pension benefits to hundreds of workers, existing workers and retirees in the Strait area. Needless to say, we're all hoping that that mill can be sold as a going concern but the workers are asking, what is plan B should that not happen. So my question is, has the Premier and his government worked out a plan as to what would happen should this wind-up deficit of $130.4 million happen to take place?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course, we would offer any assistance we can in order to make sure that that process takes place in an orderly fashion and, of course, to the greatest possible benefit to the pensioners. As the honourable member would understand, there is a wind-up process that looks at the solvency, looks at the asset base, and distributes, through the retirees, the existing benefits of the fund. You know, we have seen over and over again across Canada, unfortunately, the consequences of underfunded pension plans and, you know, it can be extremely devastating to families. We hope that that is not the case. We really do hope that we'll be able to keep that asset running and, as I said, we'll offer whatever support we can through the wind-up process, should that take place.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I'm sure, as the Premier would be aware, many of the retirees and the pension-eligible workers are wondering why is it that legislation has permitted this underfunding to take place and are questioning whether government is looking at reviewing some of the laws that exist today in light of what has taken place at NewPage and in light of what has taken place at so many other companies, and maybe the Premier can address that.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I can't advise the honourable member in that regard. I would expect that that's part of the assessment that any new purchaser would do in taking on those responsibilities but, of course, as he would know, it's currently before the monitor. They have now qualified the bids but the next thing that they're going to have to do is move forward to where those kinds of discussions would start to take place. In fact, it may even be a little further down the road because the first thing they will do is they will go kind of back through the mill, through the asset base, and try to determine what they would need in order to be able to bring that plant back on line and that's ultimately the disposition they're trying for. So it will be somewhat further down in the process before they actually get to those kinds of questions.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Most Nova Scotians understand that workers have a right to vote, to form a union if they so choose, but guess who doesn't agree with that? The Deputy Premier doesn't agree. We've known since he introduced Bill No. 220 several years ago that he believes that a union should be able to be formed without actually bothering to ask the workers to vote on its certification. That was the point of Bill No. 220.</p>

The Premier's government quietly changed the Trade Union Procedure Regulations, recently, to make it easier to become a member in good standing of the union, even removing the minimal $2 membership fee that used to be charged. My question to the Premier is this, who lobbied the Premier to make those changes that no one else appeared to be asking for?</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education. The minister continues to try to convince Nova Scotians that slashing public education and downloading costs to the school boards to the tune of $36 million is not affecting the classroom, but she is doing this without sharing real numbers. She's not sharing the realities that these cuts are affecting the classroom.</p>

As caucus members, all three Parties, the members of all three Parties had presentations from the five education partners and those presentations included real numbers. The Nova Scotia School Boards Association and the Nova Scotia Teachers Union told all of us that 82 teaching positions were lost as a result of the minister's cuts - and I will table that report.</p>

On the overall contract, though, Nova Scotia has made its position well known and has been an integral partner in the position of where this contract is right now.

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. I think we've all come to understand that many of our forestry businesses in Nova Scotia are struggling, but while there has been a lot of talk about the pulp and softwood, many in the hardwood industry feel that the challenges of people working with hardwood have been ignored. Some of the challenges can be rectified by government, as for years Crown leases and government programs have set the needs of the hardwood industry aside or as secondary. Will the minister please tell us what his plans are to establish reliable access to Crown fibre for Nova Scotia's hardwood operations?</p>

          <p>HON. CHARLIE PARKER: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I recently had the opportunity to sit down with the Eastern Hardwood Management Association, a mix of five different sawmills that specialize in hardwood in Cape Breton and eastern Nova Scotia, and I heard first-hand some of their concerns, their issues. We're working now with them through our department and Groupe Savoie, Finewood Flooring, and others. They're an important part of our economy, and we'll continue to dialogue and work with them for sustainable use of our hardwood segment.</p>

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : The minister will be well aware that Groupe Savoie Inc. came to Nova Scotia more than a decade ago to create jobs, yet continue to run into hurdles. Their Westville facility is currently operating at only 50 per cent capacity, and they tell us directly that this is because of restrictions and roadblocks they face from this government on access to hardwood. The department's own data from 2004 says that there is an abundance of hardwood volume in Nova Scotia, and yet it seems the hardwood industry is having trouble accessing it.</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Certainly there have been many challenges in the forest industry, not just here in Nova Scotia but across Canada and around the world. Hardwood is one of our most valuable resources. As I mentioned, I recently met with the Eastern Hardwood Management Association, the group of five mills, and our goal is always to make sure there is the highest and best use of our hardwood supply. In our Code of Forest Practices those regulations are fully laid out, that that will just happen. We have recently added a liaison person from the Department of Natural Resources to sit down, to meet with them, hear their issues first-hand, and move forward from there.</p>

As we work on the value-added component of our Natural Resources Strategy, moving forward there is going to be more opportunity for hardwood and other forest products. So I agree with the honourable member that we do have an opportunity here. Crown allocation is part of that opportunity, and we're going to work with the industry to try to ensure that there is a good quality supply of hardwood logs.</p>

          <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, during the Spring NDP budget, the Minister of Finance clearly targeted the Department of Justice for significant cuts to their budget, probably the largest percentage cut of any government department, to the tune of $5.3 million. While I have talked on numerous occasions about the cuts made to crime prevention programs, we're curious to ask the minister about a specific line item where he intends to make a cut to the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service to the tune of $290,000. I wonder, could the Minister of Justice advise us, exactly what services is he planning on cutting to the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office?</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, like every government department during these financial times, and in trying to get our house in order and make sure everyone is managing their departments to the best of their ability, the medical examiner's office is looking over their processes, their systems and looking at ways to increase efficiencies and make it more functional and cost effective. I'm very confident in the approach they have taken, and that they will continue to take, in looking at ways to identify those key areas where savings could be made.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, during the estimates we were able to find out from the Minister of Justice that it was this government's intention to cut autopsies on the weekend for non-essential situations. I have to say that's probably one of the more tasteless cuts that I've seen a government propose. The minister may have forgotten, but two weeks ago the Chief Medical Examiner's Office sent out notice to embalmers and undertakers advising that unless it was essential, the office would no longer be conducting autopsies on the weekends.</p>

          <from>MR. LANDRY</from>
          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, thank you for that question. He's correct on one point that he made there, the death in anyone's family is a very sensitive and emotional time in the lives of any family. The 24/7 service is costly but routine autopsies are not necessary on every weekend. Temporary measures, until April 2012, will be put in place. The medical examiner's office will continue to meet the special needs of families, especially when religious beliefs are requiring immediate burial. Autopsies for homicides will continue and autopsies on children will continue.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, we seem to be getting different messages here. In one sense the government seems to have withdrawn the reduction in service, yet the Minister of Justice is informing us today that there will still be a reduction in the sense that there will only be autopsies performed in select instances. Those who don't fall in those instances will be told to wait until Monday. The minister has acknowledged this is a sensitive issue. Families who lose a loved one for unknown reasons want answers immediately; to suggest that they have to wait until Monday is clearly unacceptable.</p>

          <p>MR. LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, other provinces have a similar model in place. I'll repeat again what the medical examiner will continue to do. They'll meet the special needs of families, especially when religious beliefs require an immediate burial; autopsies dealing with homicides or suspicious deaths will be conducted immediately; and autopsies on children will be conducted immediately. This temporary process will be in place until the Spring. Each situation will be evaluated but the 24 hours, seven days a week has to be questioned in these economic times.</p>

          <p>HON. MANNING MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. During Question Period today in response to a question from the Leader of the Official Opposition regarding the first contract arbitration, the Premier made reference to the member for Cape Breton South who was given an award by the International Association of Firefighters for that very issue, for promoting that very issue and promoting a bill to that effect in the House. He's right about one thing, I got a recommendation and a commendation, I guess, from the International Association of Firefighters. (Applause)</p>

This is a resolution that is similar - it's the same as we've seen in 1991 and in 2001 when it comes to establishing a select committee on boundary review. It's a resolution that empowers us to go out and hear from the public and then form a commission. We move this resolution and will sit and listen to debate, and hopefully it will pass today.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words on this resolution this afternoon. All Nova Scotians want to know that when the electoral boundaries are redrawn in our province, that it is done in a way that is fair in a number of different respects. First of all, that it is done in a way that is non-partisan. Secondly, that it's done in a way that no one Party gains an advantage over any other Party by virtue of the way the boundaries are drawn. Thirdly, and most importantly, Nova Scotians want to know that when the boundaries of the province are redrawn, they're redrawn in a way that is fair to the Nova Scotia voters themselves. That is the most important point.</p>

It's a pleasure to rise and make a few brief comments on Resolution No. 1846, which is the "Electoral Boundaries Commission: Select Comm. - Appoint, Hon. F. Corbett." I had the privilege almost 10 years ago to be part of the select committee that did the boundary review back in 2002, its final report. I am pleased that our Leader has asked me to once again represent our caucus on the select committee, which was actually highlighted in the resolution read by the Government House Leader.</p>

Unfortunately, I know the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party at one point was chief of staff to the Premier; I'm not sure if he was chief of staff during the last boundary review.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : There's great - and I think this is interesting, the Minister of Finance doesn't think this is interesting, but I think it's a very interesting point - helping small business in Nova Scotia grow, even by small numbers, makes a significant difference in our economy and it also gives us more stability. We're less subject to what people might call a black swan. There was belief at one time that there were no black swans in the world and then people discovered that, in fact, there were. In this day and age we're seeing more of them, and when I say more of them, I mean in the sense of more extreme events that affect our economy. If you look at it in the example I've just given, in the case of small business, by finding ways to increase their numbers incrementally, even in small amounts, we're warding off against putting all of our eggs in one basket in large industry.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Thank you, Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure to be able to rise to make a few comments on Bill No. 72, the Timely Medical Certificates Act. For those wondering why would the Justice Critic be up speaking on this, I would refer you back to Question Period earlier today and I'll get to that in a few minutes. I do as well want to recognize the member for Lunenburg. I can tell you, having been a backbencher in government, it's not always a fun place to be, it can be lonely at times.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : No, I can say I wasn't in the backbench for long and I wasn't in Cabinet for long either, in both instances, but I think there's always a very important role that back benchers can play. Too often, under the British parliamentary system, it makes it extremely different for government backbenchers to play as strong a role in this House, and outside of this House, as what I think they could do. I think that's something that we need to look at - the system that we have - because obviously it's an old system and for life in the backbench, as I said, it's not always fun and it's certainly very limiting as to what can be achieved when you're on the government side and required to support government decisions. With that I commend her for having brought this forward and I think all Nova Scotians would see this bill as a positive move.</p>

          <from>MR. MACMASTER</from>
          <p>MR. MACMASTER : About four minutes, okay thank you. What have we seen in this province? Well, we've seen the loss of 5,000 jobs in the last two years, since this government has held power in this province. That is, in an economy that's defensive by its very nature, we don't have a cyclical economy in this province, certainly nothing compared to what we would see in Alberta with the oil industry because we don't have as much dependence. I wish we did have dependence on natural resources, Madam Speaker, because those resources would be providing us with a lot of wealth and they would certainly help our economy right now.</p>

          <p>MR. CLARRIE MACKINNON : Thank you very much, Madam Speaker, it's a pleasure for me to rise tonight in this debate. It might be questioned why one of the oldest members in the House wanted to speak on this subject tonight, but I want to speak on it for a number of reasons. At the end of the Progressive Conservative regime in this province, when we look at the Elections Nova Scotia 2009 figures for my constituency, we see that 7.2 per cent of the voting population was between the ages of 18 and 24, and 20.9 per cent were over the age of 65. It's very interesting that the MLA for Fort McMurray, this week, was talking about the optimism that there is in Nova Scotia. It's very interesting to point out that that member of the Legislature in Fort McMurray is a former Cape Bretoner and he's talking about all the people who are thinking about coming back to Nova Scotia because there is hope. But there is more than hope. In this province there are concrete measures being taken by this government to make fundamental changes, and when I'm talking about changes that are taking place in this province, I'm talking about changes that are taking place in industry after industry after industry.</p>

          <from>MR. MACKINNON</from>
          <p>MR. MACKINNON : You know, Jack Layton said that hope is better than fear, and we have more than hope in this province. I just want to for a moment talk about Dave Freckleton, who is involved with the Community College Pictou Campus in Stellarton. Dave Freckleton, a great guy, and this is what he had to say about Nova Scotia right now, talking about Irving: "A young person graduating today from NSCC could still be working on this contract when they retire. This is historical and I am very excited about it." He added, "The Pictou Campus offers a lot of trades, such as welding and machinery, that will graduate workers able to use their skills not only in manufacturing but in other areas that can benefit from the spinoffs. For example, the predicted rise in employment will create the need for more houses, so people will be looking for more carpenters and more plumbers, but they will also be traveling more and eating out more, which will impact tourism and culinary students. He goes on and on about the benefits that are taking place.</p>

          <p>MR. GEOFF MACLELLAN : It certainly is a pleasure to rise in my place and speak on this resolution. We all shared the day that the shipbuilding contracts were announced and the day that Irving was the successful - the right to negotiate the successful bid was Irving and it certainly did mean a lot, for sure. Again, we're glad there was no politics involved in that, that no one influenced this decision, other than the merit.</p>
