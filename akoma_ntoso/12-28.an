          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Yesterday I tabled a statement from the Premier when he was in Opposition in this House where he said and I quote again:</p>

        <speech by="#0768c045-71ae-4890-b6be-c52eb783ee95">
          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I saw the statement yesterday when it was tabled by the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. He neglects to say that in the press release that he actually tables, I actually point out the two things that should happen in order to show leadership. This says two things that have to happen: first, Nova Scotia Power must move quickly to use more renewables, renewable energy like wind and tidal power; and secondly, help consumers with the one big thing they cannot do, which is conserve the amount of power they use.</p>

          <from>MR. BAILLIE</from>
          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Well, Mr. Speaker, you'll have to forgive Nova Scotians who, when they heard the Premier tell them that when the price of power outstrips their ability to pay that it's the government's job to step in, that they didn't notice that that promise - like so many others from him - contained a big magic asterisk. It contained two conditions that he's now disclosing that were not part of the deal at the time, that he only means it under certain conditions. Like the HST promise, like the balanced budget promise - now his power rate promise, we find out later, had conditions attached to it all along.</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I guess unlike the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, most Nova Scotians can actually read. They can read the whole text. They, in fact, endorse the agenda of this government by voting for them, the most important decision they could make. More to the point is that he uses 2008 as a year for comparison knowing full well that Efficiency Nova Scotia was not in place at that time and knowing full well that Allan Crandlemire appeared before the Public Accounts Committee and pointed out to the members opposite that more than $100 million in conservation savings were passed on to ratepayers as a result of their work.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, unfortunately for the Premier, Nova Scotians can read very well. They can read the election platform of the NDP which also said he wouldn't raise their taxes, that he would balance the budget. It said he would not let power rates go up and they can now read for themselves these new conditions that he places retroactively on his promises, like that it depended on consumption.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, what Nova Scotians know, and I hear it from them almost every day, is that unfortunately, because of decisions made by past governments, Nova Scotians - whether they are in the industrial sector or in the residential sector - are chained to the international fossil fuel market as a result of decisions made by those governments. We have higher electricity prices because of the decisions that previous governments made.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, Nova Scotians are paying some of the highest rates for power in Canada. Nova Scotia Power has gone back to the URB to try to exact more money from families and businesses. Nova Scotians have had enough, and they're looking for this government to stand up to Nova Scotia Power. So my question to the Premier is, will the Premier end Nova Scotia Power's monopoly to ensure competition with better regulations?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, the reality is that we have seen the results of deregulation in other parts of the country. What has happened with deregulation is it has actually driven up the cost of power for ordinary consumers. Unfortunately, the members of the Liberal Party believe that embarking on a deregulated market will somehow benefit ratepayers when, in fact, what it would do is harm them. (Interruptions)</p>

High electricity costs were cited as one of the three major cost drivers that were making it difficult for them to keep their doors open. Ironically the shutdown leads to even higher energy prices.

          <p>MR. CHUCK PORTER : The Nalcor and Emera deal on Muskrat Falls was due at the end of January and is over three months late. Through the current proposals Nova Scotia would be entitled to about 160 megawatts of energy. However, the subsea cable is expected to hold up to three times that capacity. We see today that the Premier has finally come around to our caucus' position that there needs to be a formal review of the project, but there are still many concerns about securing a market for the extra electricity. My question to the Minister of Energy is, has his department talked to Emera about markets for excess energy from Muskrat Falls, and what would that mean for Nova Scotia?</p>

It's going to provide 35 years of stable electricity rates for Nova Scotians, and that will help small businesses, large businesses, and families. There will be a certain contracted amount of power available once the URB decides on the format, but the extra power that's there will be available at market prices to Nova Scotians and beyond.</p>

I would point out to the member opposite that we have an entitlement to a certain set amount of electricity. The rest of that will continue to belong to the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador through their Crown agency, Nalcor. They will run that through into the competitive market in an enhanced transmission grid. That will also be good for the Province of Nova Scotia.

The cost will be based on the cost of the project, which will be reviewed by the Utility and Review Board - which, of course, is the way that every project is analyzed for the ratepayers' rate. But the great advantage to this will be that in addition to that, the extra power will flow through, into a competitive market, and then the Province of Nova Scotia will have the opportunity to buy the most competitively-priced power on the market.</p>

          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Acting Minister of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism. This government wants to keep the process around the Ships Start Here rule-breaking advertising contract secret. On March 8th our caucus, the Progressive Conservative caucus, submitted a FOIPOP application to the Department of Economic and Rural Development and Tourism, asking for the minutes of the Ships Start Here steering committee meetings, a group that met a handful of times. On April 11th we learned that the department decided to extend the 30-day response time. Now this is for a simple set of minutes sitting in a binder somewhere and then the application for an additional 30 days to May 11th, so that we are only a couple of days away from that date.</p>

          <p>HON. DAVID WILSON : Mr. Speaker, I know the member opposite is confused about the reasoning for the Ships Start Here campaign, but simply put, this is the biggest economic opportunity the province has ever seen in its history and what we need is support from all members of this House as we move forward and implement that Ships Start Here campaign and program, and the awarding of the ships contract. This government is supportive of it; I just wish that Party over there would support it also.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my first supplementary will be to the Minister of Communications Nova Scotia. Part of Communications Nova Scotia's mission is, "Working as a team we bring projects to life, from concept to design and budget, through to a successful launch." We learned today that when it comes to Ships Start Here, this government kept the concept and design a secret from CNS, but stuck them with the tab. My question to the minister is, if the Ships Start Here campaign was not a political campaign in nature, why did the government bypass the able professionals at CNS and use an outside agency that is mandated to make a profit and not use CNS, who is accountable to the taxpayers?</p>

          <from>MS. KELLY REGAN</from>
          <p>MS. KELLY REGAN : Mr. Speaker, women's organizations are concerned about the specific impact that health policy, namely mental health policy, has on women who experience domestic violence. In a report for the Canadian Women's Foundation, the BC Society of Transition Houses notes that women's experience of violence precipitates their mental health issues. The report revealed that 50 per cent of all women surveyed who had experienced violence had a clinical mental health diagnosis, compared to only 20 per cent of women who had not experienced violence. I'll table that report.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Domestic violence is certainly of concern to myself and to this government. I am aware of the correlation between mental health disorders and issues and domestic violence. The working group advising on the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy held public consultations all over the province. They met with more than 1,200 individuals and people representing various organizations. As I indicated earlier today, their work and recommendations are quite comprehensive and the strategy will follow quite closely.</p>

          <from>MS. REGAN</from>
          <p>MS. REGAN : And yet, Mr. Speaker, after all those consultations, the words "domestic violence" - we can't find them in the report. Women's organizations have concerns about the lack of consideration for domestic violence in the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy Advisory Committee's report. The Domestic Violence Action Plan clearly outlines the connection between domestic violence and mental health. Organizations therefore naturally expected to see something in the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy recommendations about domestic violence. My question to the minster is, how is your department addressing the concerns in the Domestic Violence Action Plan that specifically speak to mental health and will these items be included in the Mental Health and Addictions Strategy?</p>

I will table that particular article. This is a laudable goal, improving efficiency and bringing jobs to rural Nova Scotia. However, the Maintenance Enforcement Program has been under-resourced and understaffed for years, in fact, the average caseload per worker is 426 active cases and that doesn't even include the inactive and the cold cases.

What we have done is examined it on an ongoing basis and over the last three years we've been trying to make some fundamental changes. Some of the characteristics that surfaced were the mentoring, the coaching, the training and development of the employees who are providing that service and bringing them into a co-operative structure where they can have quick exchanges and discuss particular cases.</p>

If we continue to do the same thing over and over again, as that Opposition Party have said the system wasn't working, so we have made some changes. We're bringing people together in a co-operative manner to be able to mentor and discuss with each other issues that are going on. With the technologies that we have in place today, we're going to be able to automate the system much more quickly and get faster response, control the data information that's coming in to make sure that there are efficiencies. The difference between this government and the Opposition is that they just want to spend more money, leave things the way that they are. We want to be constructive, be progressive, and the future starts here.</p>

We don't need to move the people around, we need to actually increase the number of enforcement officers who collect the money. In fact, now, money that could be directed to improving that program is going to be eaten up by moving costs because as the minister should well know, you can't move people from one end of the province to the other without having that actually cost money. When the Auditor General suggested changes needed to be made in the program, I don't think this is what he had in mind.</p>

The infilling was approved several decades ago and most of the lands in the area are owned by the Waterfront Development Corporation, a provincial Crown Corporation.

I can assure you that the applications - you're asking kind of a general question but I can tell you that the jurisdictions that are involved, they're starting the process that is being followed, and we also know that the Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture is involved in this and also the Halifax Port Authority, and there is an application process through Nova Scotia Environment.</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : I want to thank the member for that question. I want to assure the member and all Nova Scotians that I take their safety seriously. I'm very committed, I've spent a lifetime on safety and those issues. There are protocols in place, we have policies in our institutions - for example, in one of our criminal institutions there are very clear policies that are there. For those that are in our health institutions, there are very clear policies there and I respect the management and the people who provide those services. I know they work very hard to ensure that they comply with their rules and I have no issue with what's going on there. Thank you.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : The member started off by making a point that we've learned some things about the mental health system and how people who are in forensic hospitals are patients rather than criminals who have been convicted of any criminal offence. I would also remind members that it has been more than 10 years since the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the practice where people used to be held indefinitely in psychiatric facilities on Lieutenant Governor's Warrants and put in place a process of a Criminal Review Board that would lay out the parameters under which an individual would be kept in a forensic hospital, where an assessment of risk would be done, where a treatment plan would be developed, and where decisions about integrating that person back into the community would be made by competent experts who are psychiatrists and nurses.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Mr. Speaker, while I feel for anyone who is suffering from mental illness, this is not just a health issue. An at-large person who is at risk to themselves and the public is first and foremost a public safety issue. Moreover, the system did Andre Denny no favours by not reacting sooner, and it is doing this individual no favours by not having done more to get her back into care, where she was supposed to be for good medical and safety reasons.</p>

We have to look at these situations in terms of public safety. That's why we have a forensic system. People are in that system because they do pose a risk to themselves or to someone else.</p>

          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : I earlier asked the question to the Minister of Health and Wellness regarding the policies and procedures used by her department regarding the East Coast Forensic facility when a patient fails to return after they've been given a pass. I believe the minister has indicated to us the protocols of notifying the police within 15 minutes when the patient does not return and that there is a 72-hour notification policy to the public if the patient fails to return.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, in the interest of full disclosure, allow me to assist the minister. In the matter of the Nova Scotia Review Board regarding the patient in question, which is dated January 25, 2012, it indicates that the patient returned to the hospital on her own accord on November 2nd, having been AWOL for several weeks. She reported she had spent some time in Dartmouth and then travelled to Montreal and Edmonton. Halifax Regional Police are now reporting that the patient is believed to be in the Province of Quebec. In light of this not having been the first incident, in light of the fact that the AWOL last time was for several weeks, would the Minister of Health and Wellness explain to us why she waited 72 hours before informing the public that this patient had failed to return yet again?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, this patient has been in the forensic hospital for almost a year, has had multiple leaves from the hospital in the past. The member would know because he has the documentation - on many occasions the patient has returned and on other occasions the patient did not return. The decisions to notify the public are made by the treating psychiatrist and the nurses, in consultation with the police. There are protocols in place and those protocols were followed.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, it's unfortunate that rather than having full disclosure that we have to pick apart the story day by day as more information is being made available. We were led to believe, based on the minister's responses, this was a first-time offence and that standard protocols were being followed. Now we have an actual hearing in front of us - the actual decision which tells us that this was not the first time; in fact it tells us that the last time this happened was for several weeks and that the patient travelled outside the province, in fact to the other side of the country. One would expect that Nova Scotians should be made aware of this and that the department would have tried to find ways of alerting the public immediately in the hope that the patient would remain inside the province and be able to return to the facility for care.</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, as I indicated earlier, we have procedures in place to alert the public after an individual has been away for 72 hours. There is the ability for the medical staff, who know the individuals, in consultation with the police to initiate an earlier notification to the public if they believe that the individual poses any significant risk to the public. These are decisions that are made by the nurses and doctors in the forensic service of the province, in consultation with the police.</p>

          <from>HON. MICHEL SAMSON</from>
          <p>HON. MICHEL SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, the Nova Scotia Legal Aid program provides legal representation to low-income Nova Scotians, primarily in the areas of family and criminal law. Those who access legal aid do so because they cannot afford a private lawyer. While the demand for legal aid continues to increase, this government responds with further cuts.</p>

          <p>HON. ROSS LANDRY : Mr. Speaker, every department has a responsibility to work more efficiently and effectively in trying to get ourselves back to balance. One area that came forward was I compliment the staff and all workers within the legal aid system for doing a very good part in bringing their costs under control.</p>

          <from>MR. SAMSON</from>
          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, one of the main barriers for Nova Scotians accessing legal aid is the income cap that determines who will qualify. This is a long-standing issue in this province; in fact it was raised on November 18, 2008, by the MLA for Halifax Fairview, now the Minister of Finance, while in Opposition. He said, " . . . because legal aid rates, for example - the qualifying income for legal aid is so low now that essentially anybody who's working doesn't qualify for legal aid. Even if you're working full time at minimum wage, you would still earn too much to qualify for legal aid. So you have this whole stratum of society that doesn't qualify for legal aid and yet can't afford a lawyer, and there's an enormous gap in between those two."</p>

I can't stress enough the importance about domestic violence and ensuring the population of Nova Scotia that this government is very sensitive, that's why we got the pilot project in Cape Breton with the domestic violence court. That's why we're looking at the mental health court, that's why we're taking on these types of initiatives. It's not just about putting money in one place.</p>

We felt that because of the testimony that we heard in Law Amendments Committee just a few days ago, as we were debating the issue of Bill No. 30, that it would warrant a second look at a couple of other options. A few other things that we feel that the government has not presented and really has not necessarily looked at what we feel is the restorative justice side of bullying in this province.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The intent here is for a piece of legislation that does two things: it addresses the problem in the short term and it addresses the problem in the long term. We would recommend, and we have recommended through our Law Amendments Committee, that changes be made to the existing legislation which is on the floor of the House, which is Bill No. 30, and that the changes be made there to strengthen Bill No. 30 so that some of the things that are in Bill No. 27, some of the things that we talked about, some of the things we heard, and some of the recommendations in this report can actually be included in legislation, which will show that we do mean business and that we will take action and it will happen now.</p>
