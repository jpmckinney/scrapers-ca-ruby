They have asked three times to have a debate - April 5th, October 30th and December 4th - on the Maritime Link. If you look in Hansard on May 17th, that same member spoke in favour of the Maritime Link. Once again, this is down at the URB where it can best be handled by an independent board. I do not understand why the member, after three times unlucky, would come again the fourth time. This is just wasting the time of the House with shenanigans. Thank you.</p>

Under Rule 43(4), I'm required to decide whether the matter is proper to be discussed. I have considered the factors set out in Rule 43(4A); this is a matter of grave concern to Nova Scotians, which concerns the administrative responsibilities of the government and could come within the scope of ministerial action. It is not on the order paper for discussion, and I have no indication that it is likely to be debated within a reasonable time by other means, so I will read the motion and ask whether the member for Dartmouth East has the leave of the House for the debate to take place.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the Premier and the NDP are blindly championing a multi-billion dollar Maritime Link project when they can't even tell Nova Scotians what it will mean to their power bills. Make no mistake: the Maritime Link will increase rates for Nova Scotians and their families. Over the last four years, the energy policies of the NDP government have seen Nova Scotia Power raise their bills by more than 30 per cent.</p>

We know that it will be Nova Scotia ratepayers that end up paying that bill. Even the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador is touting the fact that ratepayers in Nova Scotia are going to pay for their energy project. This is not the Premier's plan, though; this is Nova Scotia Power's plan. It is clear that Nova Scotia Power is dictating energy policy for our province, not the NDP Government.</p>

Emera has had an opportunity to dig into the pockets of ratepayers for more than a billion dollars, while our Premier sits idly by. (Interruption)</p>

BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, raising the HST on virtually every item that people buy by 2 per cent, charging the average Nova Scotian over $1,000 in extra HST under their administration - that is the mother of all cash grabs. Raising 1,400 user fees by 6 per cent when people's incomes are not going up - that is the mother of all cash grabs. And allowing a Crown Corporation under the control of this government to overcharge people - and knowingly do it - and do nothing about it, that also is a cash grab.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : You know, Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of things that we should probably make inquiries into; this is not one of them. As I pointed out, NSLC noticed the error, they refunded the people who requested refunds. They didn't ask anyone who was undercharged to pay an additional fee. But you know something, the real cash grab would be putting the HST on home energy, it would be raising Pharmacare fees by $4.5 million, and it would be raising an ambulance fee from $100 to $600. That is what the former Progressive Conservative Government did and that is the anatomy of a cash grab.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : The rising cost of power has put a squeeze on Nova Scotia families and Nova Scotia businesses. Businesses have cited high power costs as their main concern in the past few years and the expected increase in rates will continue to add more and more pressure on their bottom line.

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I know it has been a long time since the Liberals have been in power but let's just cast our minds back. It was the last Liberal Government that actually created Emera; it's the one that brought forward the legislation to establish it in the first place. It was Liberal Governments in the 1960s and 1970s that established the strategy for Nova Scotia that led us into fossil-fuel burning power generation. It is the mistakes of the past made by former Liberal, and frankly former Progressive Conservative Governments, that have led to the energy situation of today.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, unfortunately it is Nova Scotians who are living under the mistakes of the NDP Government over the last four years. They've caused energy prices to increase 30 per cent. Statistics Canada data shows that under the NDP Government, rates have risen by more than 30 per cent, I might add the largest increase in the entire country. This rapid increase is directly tied to the Premier's inability to stabilize rates. It is quite obvious that his policy hasn't worked.</p>

Two years ago the NDP hiked over 1,400 user fees, and on Thursday we learned that the NDP was hiking the same fees again. Two years ago the NDP hike was 2 per cent on most of those fees and this time it is 5.8 per cent on the same fees. This means that since taking office in 2009, the NDP have hiked government user fees by nearly 8 per cent.</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, no one likes it when prices have to increase, but the reality is that fees have not increased for a number of years, and the costs of delivering those services are going up. In addition, this is a year that this province will move back to a balanced budget - something I'm very proud that we have been able to do - and we've been able to do it without putting tolls on the highway and without turning our schools over to the private sector to build and run, like the P3 schools of the former Liberal Government. In fact, when it comes to user fees, the Liberal Party invented user fees in this province.</p>

You're not losing anything, and business is not gaining anything; it's cost-neutral, so it's wonderful. It's no more than a talking point for the chambers of commerce while you maintain not telling them the other part of the equation - which is really duplicity, if you ask me.

Now we know that they have reached into the pockets of Nova Scotians raising 1,400 user fees to gain another $11.6 million to throw into the government pot. There are 121 pages of new fee increases, and among those increases are fees for home support, user fees which are going up to $12.10 an hour while the charge for cancelling a home support visit goes up to $59.30 per occurrence. I ask the Premier, have the incomes of seniors who have to pay for these new fees gone up by 6 per cent to match the increase or is this just another NDP cash grab?</p>

On Thursday we will bring a balanced budget to this House for all Nova Scotians to have so we can move forward, not like the former Party that saddled us with generations of debt or, may I say, their federal cousins that are cutting and slashing federal jobs in Cape Breton. When you see jobs lost at Parks Canada, when you see Service Canada cut, when you see veterans being affected - we won't do stuff like that. We'll stand up and fight it. Thank you.</p>

The minister may not wish to discuss what's coming in the upcoming budget, but perhaps he will recall sitting across from myself and sitting next to his colleagues, and the motion moved by the member for Lunenburg - and I will table that - which approved the Auditor General's budget request, with no freeze; in fact, an $83,000 increase.

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is for the Minister of Education. Last year school boards were asked to submit provincial Student Services surveys to the Department of Education. On those surveys they outlined the number of students accessing direct student service and supports. The information was sent to the minister, and it also showed a number of students who were referred but were still waiting for service. This list showed students waiting for access to school psychologists and to speech language pathologists.</p>

          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, this government recognizes that children in our school system need the support of school psychologists and speech pathologists. It was very interesting to note that I did go back and look at our supposed wait-list that was reported last week by the member opposite, to find out that this province actually is far ahead of every other province in Canada, that children on a list for an appointment, it takes about six to eight months to access service in this province.</p>

The school board submitted that information last year at the end of June and the survey showed that there were up to 2,000 students waiting for access to school psychologists and speech language pathologists. There were 650 students alone in elementary schools who are waiting for that access.</p>

GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, parents are telling us that as recently as today, the wait to see the autism team at the IWK is anywhere from nine months to one year, so while the government talks about no longer having a lottery system for EIBI, there are still significant challenges when it comes to an actual diagnosis. In fact, some children age out, enter the school system, are finally diagnosed in the school system, only to go on a wait-list for special needs in the school system. Children with autism are on a perpetual wait-list.</p>

          <p>MR. WILSON : Mr. Speaker, here we go again, the Liberal Party misleading Nova Scotians. They should be ashamed of themselves. Every single child in Nova Scotia who needs to get the EIBI program before they go to school will get it. That's a change from the practice of the past. I'm very proud of the accomplishments that we've managed here in Nova Scotia in our government over the last four years but it's typical of the Liberals to say just whatever. It doesn't matter if it's true or not.</p>

It should go through the same tests as any test that a government bill goes through and that is: does it actually make life better for Nova Scotians? Does it actually bring their energy bills down? Does it actually make it easier to balance the family budget at the end of the month - or for a small business to pay its bills and focus on getting new customers and hiring more Nova Scotians instead of trying to find the money to pay what are the highest power bills in all of Canada?</p>

I believe the Government House Leader was given ample opportunity to answer the question, simply say, no, that was not the case so I think it is very clear there was no allegation of intent, instead it was a question that was put that the Government House Leader could have easily dismissed.

Nova Scotians are going to hear the sound of a government virtually patting itself on the back, from Yarmouth to Sydney and all points in between, but I hope they know what a virtual world the Leader of the government and the government is now living in when they break their arm patting themselves on the back like that because whatever they say has to be weighed against the record of the NDP, particularly when it comes to budget matters: the $27 million hole they didn't tell us about just last year; the idea that they think it is grand that they try to raise revenue on the backs of everyday Nova Scotians by raising the HST to the highest in the country, after promising not to; saying they are going to have a paper balance in a few days - four years late from what they promised Nova Scotians; the craziness of tabling a budget in this House that had zero dollars for health equipment, something that made no sense to any single, common sense Nova Scotian.

Today I heard more of the same from the minister when he talked about broadening issues that are not even contemplated in this bill about other aspects of consultation and so on. The fact of the matter is that previous to the election he and his Party, when they talked about what they were going to do, the buzz was break the monopoly. When we said no, it's deregulation, they flat out said, oh no, it's not deregulation and now they're saying it's deregulation.</p>

In fact there are a number of ministers actually working on that. What I will say however, and the member should be aware, is that the single most expensive type of energy that Nova Scotia Power was using today was coal. It was double the cost of the power that they were importing across the border - double.</p>

I don't think I need too many notes prepared for this because there are a number of themes that run consistently through this Legislature. I think that when we sat through the almost hour of the Speech from the Throne we got to hear the government's favourite themes - we got to hear their buzz words and their slogans and their jingles that have been running this government for the last four years.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to join the emergency debate. This is a very important topic to Nova Scotians. Constituents that I talk with and who come to my office are taking notice and they definitely know that there is a great deal to analyze and dissect around this issue. In terms of the debate it is around the fact that the URB has simply too short a timeline of 180 days to allow for submissions and the hearing process to take place. Now I know the Minister of Energy makes light of this and there were other opportunities, and so forth, to present submissions but the real intervening, the real look by the URB is in fact that six-month period and this is very much a moving project that keeps getting additional information added on as we move to the point where the project gets underway and moves towards an anticipated completion date of 2017.</p>

Those are the words of the Premier who long ago made up his mind, who before the Maritime Link hearings even start has sanctioned the project allowing Emera to go ahead with their work, incurring costs, accepting that a penalty will be payable by the taxpayers of Nova Scotia if there are any changes to the regulations in the future.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow candidates in this election: John Frank Toney from Eskasoni, who ran for the NDP; Stemer MacLeod, who ran as an independent; and Keith Bain, former MLA for Victoria-The Lakes, who just happens to be my country neighbour - a fine gentleman and a true good community member. (Applause) We all ran clean campaigns, and no matter what the outcome, we can hold our heads up high.</p>
