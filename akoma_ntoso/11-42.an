          <p>HON. DARRELL DEXTER : Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a minute to stress with members today the importance of voting as much as we can for the Bay of Fundy in the last few days of the New7Wonders of Nature campaign. You all know the Bay of Fundy is the only Canadian finalist in that competition. With the highest tides in the world, the Bay of Fundy is truly an extraordinary natural wonder.</p>

Of course, all of us in this Chamber would like to see the Bay of Fundy become one of the seven wonders, although some of us get confused when we mention the seven wonders because I've often heard the seven colleagues to my left referred to as such, on occasion, the seven wonders here.

It's an important one in my own riding, in Cumberland South, a riding the Premier seems to have taken an amazing interest in over the last little while in a number of different areas.

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons we have a government is to protect ratepayers from a monopoly in this province gouging you each time they go to the board. Nova Scotia Power has misled and manipulated the media, families and businesses, and the Premier has stood by and let it happen. Quite frankly, the Premier should be embarrassed that this is happening under his watch. He would not stand up for Nova Scotians and against Nova Scotia Power. My question to the Premier, will the Premier stand up against Nova Scotia Power and support Nova Scotia families?</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, they took the HST off electric bills, they put in the DSM charge and I'm sure many of the people in this province refer to that as the NDP electricity tax. They've increased the HST on every other consumable and they increased 1,400 user fees in this province. So, if he's looking out for Nova Scotia families, God help them if he's going to be looking out for them.</p>

        <heading>PREM.: FIRST CONTRACT ARBITRATION SCHEME - STOP</heading>
        <speech by="#adf62df0-6616-4824-87bd-59fd0bc41914">
          <from>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE</from>
          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, first contract arbitration provides unnecessary risk just at a time when Nova Scotia needs to be investment-ready to take advantage of the great opportunity that the shipyard contract brings for all of us. Businesses that are interested in setting up shop in Nova Scotia today will get cold feet because they understand the dangers of an imposed arbitration on an innocent employer. The fact of the matter is, if the government proceeds with this scheme they will blow it when it comes to the great shipbuilding opportunity that all Nova Scotia has. My question to the Premier is, will he do the right thing and put a stop to this first contract arbitration scheme before he truly does blow the shipbuilding opportunity?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we worked with Irving shipyards to ensure that the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy was an effective vehicle for them to win that contract. Of course, Irving Shipbuilding is a unionized business; they won it on merit and they won it with those collective agreements in place. I would point out that 85 per cent of Canadians, more than 80 per cent of Canadians, are already covered by first contract arbitration. There are very few jurisdictions in this country that don't already have it.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, more than 80 per cent of Canadians are going to get flu this winter; that doesn't make it a good thing. The Premier insists that first contract arbitration is only for unionized workplaces, but companies like Michelin have told him that is not so. My question to the Premier is, in light of this great shipbuilding opportunity, will he assure Michelin and other non-unionized workplaces that they won't be left out because of this first contract arbitration scheme?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, in the world of questions, that's what's known as a non sequitur. Any contractor that wants to bid into the supply chain on those contracts, I'm sure Irving would welcome those bids because after all, as they go through the work they're going to be looking for the lowest cost, highest quality supplier at each point in the supply chain.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure that will be of great comfort to Michelin and the other non-unionized workplaces of the province. What would be of great comfort to them as they decide how best to invest in Nova Scotia and create jobs is knowing they have a government that won't proceed with this crazy plan at this time when we need sound management practices and labour practices the most.</p>

The one thing I hear over and over again, wherever I go and whoever I talk to about the business landscape in Nova Scotia, is this: we have some of the best and most loyal employees anywhere in the world.

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the Premier stated that I was using rhetoric in my question when I was talking about power rate increases. It's not rhetoric; it's reality, and the Premier is out of touch with it. Gary Weir in Yarmouth tells us:</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I know how difficult it is for people, particularly disabled people on relativity limited income. I realize how difficult that is, to make ends meet. Perhaps the Leader of the Official Opposition would tell Mr. Weir and his family whether or not, if he were in government, he would put the HST back on electricity and back on home heating oil as they campaigned to do.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, I don't know Mr. Knowlton, and I'm sure that if his cost structure in his business was such that power rates caused his closure, then that was a difficult business for him to be in. What I would say, though, is that the Government of Nova Scotia does not control the power rates in this province. They are set through an independent process, through the Utility and Review Board. In fact, they are put there specifically to keep politics out of power rates.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question again is for the Premier. Yesterday Statistics Canada confirmed that Nova Scotia was the worst-performing province in the country in 2010. That was the same year that the Premier increased the HST. The data released yesterday also confirmed that Nova Scotia actually avoided the recession of 2009. That was the reason the Premier told Nova Scotians he had to raise their taxes.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Well, Mr. Speaker, of course, I object to the characterization that the Leader of the Official Opposition has just thrown out. The simple fact of the matter is the reason why we had to return the HST to 15 per cent, where the Liberals put it in the first place, was because we had to deal with a $1.4 billion projected deficit.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, talk about rhetoric in this House - just listen to the Premier talk about the $1.4 billion projected deficit. His government hired Deloitte, gave them the parameters to say, what would happen if we continued to spend at the enormous rate the previous Progressive Conservative Government was spending at and revenue fell through the floor? I can tell you what would happen. We would have a situation that would be difficult for government to deal with but those were not the facts. The Premier created a false scenario so he go out and raise the HST.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, as was pointed out by the Economic Council and the eminent economists who looked at the Province of Nova Scotia, they said no one thing was going to be sufficient to correct the budget imbalance, the deficit-laden budgets that we were left with. So it would be necessary to increase revenues to ensure that we cut our cost structure and, thirdly, that we help business grow in the province, and we are doing all of those.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, the only thing the Premier has done since he has taken office is misrepresent the facts in front of Nova Scotians. He knows full well that he created a scenario where the revenue side was going through the floor and he's padded spending numbers at every chance he got during budgets. He has broken every promise when it comes to taxes for the people of Nova Scotia. So, Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the Premier, how can Nova Scotians believe you now?</p>

Last week we learned that the NDP Minister of Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations, the former NDP Leader and now federal MP Robert Chisholm's own road was paved by the new but not-so-shiny, expensive, NDP Government double chip-sealing machine.

The limits, including the caps in Manitoba, were put in place at the same time. We have tried to prevail upon the Minister of Citizenship, Immigration and Multiculturalism and others to understand the inequity that is inherent in the current system.

First contract arbitration would prevent that.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, this question or a form of this question has been asked over and over again. As I pointed out, 85 per cent of Canadians are already covered by first contract. It's a standard piece of labour legislation across the country. It was brought in by Progressive Conservatives, it was brought in by Liberals, and it was brought in by New Democrats. It was brought in in various provinces in the country simply because it was good legislation. It was brought in federally, I understand by the Liberals. I'm not sure exactly what the objection of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party is, but perhaps he'll better articulate it.</p>

          <p>MR. LEO GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Community Services announced changes to a program which increased income thresholds to support more families. I wouldn't get too excited, because I think there's some embarrassment about to come. Unfortunately, the Minister of Health and Wellness falls short when it comes to assessing income guidelines for her department's own Boarding, Transportation and Ostomy Program, better known as the BTO Program. In order to qualify for the program, you must not only be struggling with all the challenges associated with battling cancer, your family income also cannot be greater than $15,720. My question to the Minister of Health and Wellness is, why does she continue to ignore the fact that the qualifying income of $15,720 for the BTO Program is unacceptably low?</p>

We have many, many programs in our department that have income-tested thresholds. I have asked my department, and I continue to ask my department, to keep me apprised of reviews that are done routinely as we prepare for coming budget deliberations. The program that is in place with the thresholds exists for this year and we constantly review those as we look toward budget preparation for the following year.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Families who have a loved one battling cancer, just like every other family in this province, are finding it tough to make ends meet. Gas prices since the last time this program saw an income adjustment have risen 100 per cent. Power rates in this province have increased 36 per cent in the last 10 years. The last time the income threshold for this program increased was 17 years ago under a Liberal Government. The BTO Program, quite simply, helps cancer patients with transportation costs to Sydney or Halifax for treatment, helps with boarding costs when assessing treatment, and helps with ostomy supplies. My question to the minister is, will cancer patients who are struggling with everyday costs ever be made a priority by this government?</p>

          <p>MS. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, people who suffer from cancer certainly are a priority for this government. That's why we invested $3 million with the Cancer Society's Lodge That Gives, for their capital campaign - the first ones to come to the table with money for the expansion of services so that when people come from around rural Nova Scotia to get treatment here in the Capital District, they are able to have their lodging covered and they don't have to worry about where they're going to stay and how much that costs - and that makes a huge difference in their lives. Additionally, we have invested millions of dollars in radiation treatment expansion so that we will be able to meet the radiation wait times guarantees.</p>

At that time the member spoke of 15 years of no change, and it has now been 17 years. The NDP increased the HST by 2 per cent for every one of those families, gas prices have increased, and it has become more expensive for power, which is often the source of heat for families, yet this government has failed to act.

          <p>MS. REGAN : Mr. Speaker, since 1983 Alice Housing has provided safe, affordable housing for women and children leaving abusive situations. As power rates increase, it becomes more difficult for Alice Housing to operate. Each year power costs eat up a larger portion of their operating costs. For example, Alice Housing will be installing security cameras in the coming months to make the facility safer for their clients. These cameras need electricity to work and these costs will come out of Alice Housing's budget. What is the minister going to tell the women and children of Alice Housing when they can no longer access services because these high power rates have crippled the organization they've come to rely on?</p>

The Minister of Justice has said time and time again, based on his previous background in law enforcement, that if you do the crime, you do the time.

          <from>HON. WAYNE GAUDET</from>
          <p>HON. WAYNE GAUDET : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. Road safety is a big concern for all motorists, and with the cuts to the brush-cutting budgets this year, the department is picking and choosing areas where brush-cutting and maintenance are taking place along our roads. The number of dead animals on our roads has also seemed to increase. Many times motorists don't see these animals stepping on our roads until the last minute, because of the high brush along our roads, and they don't see them coming out of the woods. My first question to the minister is, what is the department doing to address safety on our roads?</p>

          <p>MR. GAUDET : Mr. Speaker, the high grass and brush along the sides of our roads put extra pressure on our drivers. On top of paying close attention to their driving, they have to pay special attention to watching the sides of the road in case a wild animal runs in front of them. If brush-cutting continues to be scaled back, more wild animals are going to get run over and the number of accidents on our roads will likely increase. My question to the minister is, can the minister tell us if the number of accidents on our roads has increased this year because of high brush along the sides of our roads?</p>

          <p>MR. ESTABROOKS : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. I don't have those statistics - that would be a question I would ask - but I can use a prominent example of a member of the House who sits on the opposite side, who is concerned about Route 217. On Route 217 there was a commitment made that there would be brush-cutting done on that particular road. When I was approached as the minister this morning, the staff - I went to staff and said that if the commitment was made for brush-cutting on Route 217, the commitment will be kept. After all, that's how we get things done when a member opposite or a member on this side of the House looks at an important issue, whether it is brush-cutting, whether what part of the province - bring it to my attention, and I will respond.</p>

          <p>MR. PORTER : Mr. Speaker, according to the annual adjusted rates filed yesterday by Nova Scotia Power, if NewPage is to come back on line in 2012, the load following rate would be significantly underestimated and would result in a cost spike for ratepayers affected by the fuel adjustment mechanism, such as seniors and low-income residents, small business and large industrials, all of which are struggling with the spiralling power rates due to this government's calculated need to ram through its bite-the-bullet electricity plan. The load following ratepayers are not impacted by the fuel adjustment mechanism and would not have to bear these costs, even though they were the ones who obtained the savings.</p>

          <from>MR. KEITH BAIN</from>
          <p>MR. KEITH BAIN : My question is to the Minister of the Emergency Management Office. Hazardous material Hazmat teams are crucial to public safety and integral components of protecting all Nova Scotians. Mr. Speaker, my question through you to the minister is, will he tell this House who supplies Hazmat services when an incident occurs on the South Shore?</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, there isn't a dedicated Hazmat team in the South Shore. The area is being served by HRM or Kentville, and Kentville will only respond to accidents that occur on Highway No.103. Local fire departments believe a well-trained Hazmat team is needed. So my question to the minister is, will the minister commit today to provide funding for this important piece of public safety infrastructure and for sufficient training?</p>

          <p>MR. BAIN : Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for that. On June 22nd a tragic accident occurred in Shelburne County, an accident that resulted in loss of life and a gasoline- and diesel fuel-fed fire. Unfortunately there was no Hazmat team in Shelburne to respond.</p>

On June 30, 2011 the Prescription Drug Overdoses in Nova Scotia Working Group presented its recommendation to the Minister of Health and Wellness.

          <p>MR. MAT WHYNOTT : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I'm glad to rise today in my place to take part in this debate, a debate that I'm certainly glad the Opposition brought forward. I can stand in my place and know that some of the things this government is doing to ensure and help families make ends meet is so important, everything that we do at the decision-making tables. I'd like to begin by talking about some of the things we have done since forming government. Those include helping over 75,000 Nova Scotia seniors and others who live on low and modest incomes make ends meet. It's interesting though, the Opposition doesn't mention any of those and the question I have for them would be, does the Opposition disagree with some of the things that we are putting into place, some of the things that we've done for low-income seniors and low-income Nova Scotians?</p>
