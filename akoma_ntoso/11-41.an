          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. Yesterday APEC downgraded the projections for the Nova Scotia economy. It is not hard to figure out why when you consider that Nova Scotia has some of the highest taxes in the entire country.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, just to correct the Leader of the Official Opposition, first contract legislation does not, in fact, affect non-union businesses, it has no impact on them whatsoever. What we are doing to build confidence in the business community is we're going out and ensuring that we win contracts like the Ships Start Here, the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. We're signing agreements with Newfoundland and Labrador to build the Lower Churchill project and we're supporting good projects like the new convention centre in Halifax.

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, this week the Toronto-Dominion Bank tells us that the shipyard opportunity will result in 3,200 new jobs for Nova Scotians. Sadly, the fact of the matter is that in the last year alone in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia has lost 2,100 jobs, in southwest Nova Scotia we have lost 2,500 jobs in our province - a total of 4,600 in those two regions alone, far outweighing the opportunity of the shipyard contract. I have a simple question for the Premier, does the Premier agree that maintaining current jobs is as important as receiving new ones?</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, it's pretty sad when the Premier's proud of the fact that our labour force has actually shrunk because his government and its policies have driven so many Nova Scotians completely out of our province. However, I am glad that he at least acknowledges that maintaining current jobs is as important as receiving new ones. Given that, surely we can all agree that schemes like first contract arbitration are coming in at exactly the wrong time, when our economy is as weak as it is, when we have a great opportunity to send a positive signal to the rest of the country that this is a place where jobs can be created, where businesses can grow, his government actually wants to tell people this is the wrong place to invest. My question to the Premier is, in light of these job losses, will he at least agree that now is not the time to proceed with his job-killing, first contract arbitration bill?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, first contract legislation exists right across the country. It was introduced in various jurisdictions by Progressive Conservative Governments, by Liberal Governments, by NDP Governments. I don't think the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party would suggest that all of those jurisdictions - whether they were Progressive Conservative or Liberal, or whatever they were - were trying to kill jobs. They were trying to create stability for both employers and employees and that's why it's a reasonable thing to consider.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, bad ideas may exist in other places but that is no excuse for bringing them here at a time when we can least afford it. A few years ago in this House all Parties supported the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act which integrated the desire to grow our economy and create jobs with the wish that we all have for a green economy, this is something that had all-Party support. But the NDP changed when they got into office, now they have thrown that balance completely out of whack and are telling Nova Scotians to pay the bill with their "bite the bullet" electricity plan. At a time when Nova Scotia needs to attract jobs and send a signal that we're open for business, the NDP are taking us in the wrong direction.</p>

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, it seems that the Premier is content to remain silent on the current power rate increase in front of the URB. He has refused to order a performance value audit of Nova Scotia Power operations, now he says there's too much paperwork for the people at Nova Scotia Power. The priority of the Premier should not be how much paperwork Nova Scotia Power's doing, his priority should be the power rates that Nova Scotians are being forced to pay.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, of course we have made our thoughts on the power situation known. What we fundamentally need to do in this province is change the power equation. I know the Leader of the Opposition wants studies and he wants audits and he wants all kinds of paperwork done but that's going to get the province nowhere. What we need to do is ensure that we have a program that gets us off of fossil fuels and on to renewables which will give us a stable electricity rate environment.</p>

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Well, Mr. Speaker, while we're waiting for stable energy prices the Premier's allowing Nova Scotia Power to run roughshod over the rate base in Nova Scotia instead of demanding that that company do like every other business in this province has done, look internally for savings. There is not a single member of this House who is opposed to renewable energy, what we're opposed to is the Premier sitting silently by while Nova Scotia Power continually goes back to the rate base looking for more and more money. Small businesses in this province said their biggest concern is the power rates being phased in. My question to the Premier is, why will the Premier continually ignore the concerns of small business in this province?</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : I don't ignore them at all, Mr. Speaker, but I think the Leader of the Official Opposition just missed the comments of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party with respect to renewable energy. For a small business we understand that everything is price sensitive, is cost sensitive for them, so that's why we reduced the small business tax by 20 per cent.</p>

The Premier has ordered massive cuts to health care and education in this province. The Minister of Health and Wellness has ordered the district health authorities to find those cuts inside of their organizations. The Minister of Education has ordered provincial school boards to find those cuts inside of their organizations yet the Premier refuses to order Nova Scotia Power to find the savings in the company's operations. My question to the Premier is, why is the NDP Government prepared to go after students and patients with deep cuts but unwilling to go after Nova Scotia Power executives?</p>

          <from>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD</from>
          <p>MR. ALFIE MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be for the Premier. First, I would like to thank the Premier for raising awareness about the concerns surrounding the abandoned MV Miner stranded off of Scaterie Island in Cape Breton. This issue is of serious concern for me and my constituents because this ship is only about one-half kilometre away from a scallop fishery and is in an area where lobster traps are planted during the season. My question to the Premier is this, I know that certain hazardous material has been removed from the ship such as fire extinguishers, transformers and light fixtures, has there been any asbestos found and if so, what is the government's plan to have it removed?</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, we had done an analysis of what actually existed on the vessel. As I understand it, there is what is called asbestos-laden material. In other words, some of the materials that were used, likely on the inside of the vessel, either in the walls or in the deck walls, perhaps insulation in some of the compartments, may contain asbestos. What we did is we contracted to do the cleanup that needed to be done, and could be done, given the weather window that existed and that on which we could agree to have funded. That's what has been done to date.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago I had the opportunity to go out and have a look at this ship. At that time there was a large hole in the side of the bulk carrier. Since then, with the weather that has taken place, that hole has gone through to the other side. I've been told that there is asbestos on that ship and as a matter of fact, on October 13th the Premier said ". . . he wants Ottawa to deal with further environmental cleanup of the vessel, which he said contains some asbestos-laden material and a transformer containing PCBs . . ."</p>

          <from>THE PREMIER</from>
          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, I think he just reiterated all the things that I just said, in that question. Of course, we are undertaking to ensure that the environmental cleanup, with respect to the MV Miner, is done in as expeditious a fashion as possible. Of course, we are also trying to ensure that the companies and the jurisdictions that have responsibility for that cleanup take that responsibility and that it doesn't rest on the shoulders of the taxpayers and the people of Nova Scotia.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLEOD : Mr. Speaker, on October 7th the Canadian Press reported, "Dexter said he would make sure the stricken vessel is quickly removed if the current salvage operation gets bogged down . . ." Only five days later in the Canadian Press they reported that the Premier said that the province was now considering removing the contaminants and ultimately the ship itself. I will table both of those articles.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, there's no question that the best time to remove that ship would have been when it first foundered on the rock. Unfortunately, neither the company that was towing it nor the federal Department of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities had either the means or the regulatory ability to make that happen. The result is that the ship has continued to deteriorate in terms of its physical structure, and that is causing greater and greater trouble. I'm sure the member understands that we are now into the time of year which makes the further removal of it not impossible but much more difficult and certainly much more dangerous.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you is to the Minister of Education. The minister has stated in this House that the student/teacher ratio in the Province of Nova Scotia is 13 students per one teacher. What most people don't understand is what does that really mean? How is that calculated?</p>

          <from>HON. RAMONA JENNEX</from>
          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, that's calculated by how much money is provided to the school boards for their teaching allocation. I just would like to say that the member is right, that is confusing to people. That's 13 to 1 in the calculations. It does not necessarily mean one teacher per classroom; that's the allocations of staff in schools.</p>

The NDP Government choice to cut funding through the Rural Impact Mitigation Fund in the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal by 50 per cent this summer. Now we hear from concerned citizens that winter road maintenance will be cut this year as well putting Nova Scotian roads at risk.

You know, as we prepare for the long winter ahead and the difficulties, of course, of financially meeting commitments, whether it's ice control or whether it's snow removal, one of the obligations of this department and senior staff has been to review snowplow routes, as it should be. There are snowplow routes across this province, some that go a mere two kilometres to others that go 80 kilometres and therefore the department has gone and reviewed this through a committee process.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, we learned last week that the Government of New Brunswick is making $4 million worth of cuts to winter road maintenance. However, here in Nova Scotia, the NDP Government is keeping their cuts to winter maintenance budget a secret. Today is the first day the minister has even acknowledged that such a review is even taking place but we do know that a review is underway that is being held without public knowledge. This was confirmed by a TIR spokesperson that discussions on ways to improve plowing efficiency are taking place provincially, that everything is on the table and there will not likely be a formal consultation process with the public.</p>

          <p>MR. ESTABROOKS : Well secrecy is not the issue of this particular department. There are people across the province who are aware that they've been coming to your office about the concerns and as a conscientious MLA, which you are as other members present, it's important that you bring them to my attention so we can deal with them.

CHRISTOPHER D'ENTREMONT : Mr. Speaker, in an effort to balance his budget, the Premier - together with the Department of Health and Wellness - announced that they would be encouraging the district health authorities to find a 3 per cent reduction in their budgets this year while having no impact whatsoever on patient care. Executives from the health authorities have spoken out on a number of occasions about the likelihood that such a cut will impact patient care.

We'll also continue any time there is an approval, we'll take the best interests of the environment and the traditional fisheries. Thank you for the question.</p>

          <p>HON. JAMIE BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Natural Resources. This summer, under cloak of darkness, officials of the minister's department removed the steps leading to the Joggins Beach. Those steps are important to the area of Joggins, both as an important piece of tourism infrastructure and they are important for public safety.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, in addition to suggesting that there had been some consultation, the minister and his department say that the current landowner, where those steps rest, didn't want to have the steps on his property anymore. Everyone in the area knows that is not the case. So I ask the minister, will he table any evidence he has that there was truly some discussion with the landowner in that regard, and if it turns out it didn't happen after all, like the people of Joggins know, will he commit to putting those steps back where they belong?</p>

          <p>MR. PARKER : Mr. Speaker, certainly safety is the primary concern here. Nothing overrides or overrules safety in the area, and that's really why this decision was made. The old steps were worn out and needed to be removed and that's exactly what was done in this case. In conjunction with the current landowner and the consultation in the area, that's exactly what we did.</p>

          <p>MR. BAILLIE : Mr. Speaker, if safety were truly the concern of that minister and his department, then they would know that having two access points to that beach is the safest way of getting people down and back from the Joggins Beach - not one - and the fact of the matter is, the only other way down to the beach is a controlled access through the Joggins Fossil Centre. That is a fact. So will the minister agree to review this decision, and if all of those things he said prove as false, as the people of Joggins know they are, will he put those steps back where they belong?</p>

The reason for this, of course, is to assist law enforcement to be able to track individuals who may be committing crimes, may have committed crime in the past and who may be trying to hide from that and perhaps commit crime again and that concerns us.</p>

          <p>MR. ANDREW YOUNGER : Thank you, Madam Speaker. I'm pleased to rise today and speak on the resolution brought forward by the member for Glace Bay. I had the privilege of working for CBC television and radio as my first job in journalism and it began just days into my journalism degree, due to the unfortunate circumstances at the time of the crash of Swissair Flight 111 and I was hired shortly thereafter to do some of the broadcasting of that and stayed with CBC as a casual employee for a number of years, until going on to do other work.</p>
