It was in the public domain before the minister had responded. With those few comments I would like, when you make your decision, to have that in mind - that this was public knowledge before the minister responded. Thank you.</p>

          <p>THE PREMIER : Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the House I reviewed the information that was provided by the minister, and I have to say, I've often thought that the questions that get asked are difficult ones for any minister. It's particularly difficult for ministers with portfolios like the Department of Community Services. I found the answer that the minister gave in relation to that file to be compassionate, to be understanding, and trying to address what is a very serious issue, and she did so. I think that was entirely appropriate.</p>

          <p>MR. D'ENTREMONT : Clearly this Premier excuses every incompetence within this government. With every breach he stands by a budget cover-up of $27 million, which his Treasury Board deliberately overlooked, but the Auditor General did not. He kept his minister around with demoted responsibilities in spite of a string of issues that shows that she is not up to the job and he himself thinks it's okay for a Premier not to know what is happening with his own government, but he is the Premier who ducked responsibility or leadership at every turn.</p>

The NDP have claimed again yesterday that the Muskrat Falls project is the cheapest solution for energy for Nova Scotians, yet they have not proved that or, if they have the proof, they are hiding the information from Nova Scotians.

          <p>MR. YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dalton's report has been widely discredited by many of the experts in the field who have said that it actually misrepresented a lot of the numbers. He actually made claims about organizations that the organizations themselves said were inaccurate. This is exactly what the NDP did with the recent call for proposals on renewable energy. They set up a process whereby Nova Scotia Power could undercut independent renewable energy suppliers and download the cost to ratepayers. If you look at the South Canoe project, as an example, it moves ahead with uncertain costs when in fact, Dalton, who the minister referenced, said that he told the department that there were risks associated with the way that would be done.</p>

Let me read a comment from the Hansard Subcommittee of the Whole House on Supply, October 5, 2009 about prepaying universities and fiscal shell games, "Well, I have a view of why they did that. They did that in order to make this year's books look as good as possible, knowing they were on the eve of an election."</p>

          <p>HON. MAUREEN MACDONALD : Mr. Speaker, universities are a really important feature of Nova Scotia's economy and our learning environment. We're very lucky to have a strong university sector in our province. And if universities are in a situation where they require support from this government on an annual basis, we work very hard to accommodate what those needs are. Whether or not there's a prepayment in any year, it means that the next year, it might also be prepaid, but it doesn't make any difference really. It means that the money is properly accounted for, the payments go to where they're needed and this gives us the strong university sector that we enjoy in the province.</p>

The Premier might want to talk to his own Deputy Minister of Finance, who in Public Accounts yesterday said that the department sent the information to the Treasury Board.

The budget is prepared by the Department of Finance. It's based on the budget revenue estimates - remember, they're forecasts that are done on March 1st. Everything else that comes after that at that time, as was the practice with 10 years of Progressive Conservative Governments, is included in the first forecast update.

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I also thank him for the answer. It's our desire to meet with the stakeholders there. I think the member is aware that the department had given Strait Area Transit about $120,000 last Fall, and another $5,000, I think, two weeks ago. I think before we get too far down that road we want to have a discussion with stakeholders in the area, in particular the municipal units, to see what is possible to try to ensure the long-term sustainability of that service for the people in the Strait area.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I would certainly hope that the minister would be prepared to have that meeting as soon as possible. I can tell you, my office has been flooded with calls - parents of children who are attending the ROC in Port Hawkesbury, for example, on a daily basis. We're hearing from students who go to the community college, from people who have regularly-scheduled medical appointments, whether it be physio or dialysis, and they really have no option as to how they are going to get to and from now that Strait Area Transit has ceased its operations.</p>

          <p>HON. KAREN CASEY : Mr. Speaker, my question through you will be to the Minister of Education. Yesterday, after two attempts, the minister was unable or unwilling to answer a very simple question: how many school boards will see budget cuts this year? I trust that the minister has been briefed on that by now or has read some media coverage, so my question is, how many school boards will see budget cuts this year?</p>

          <from>HON. RAMONA JENNEX</from>
          <p>HON. RAMONA JENNEX : Mr. Speaker, we have eight school boards in the Province of Nova Scotia, and three of those school boards will be receiving more funding based on the population that they have within their schools, and five school boards will be receiving funding appropriate to the number of students that they have in their system. We were able to make sure that we have guaranteed that our permanent teachers will be able to retain jobs by capping the reductions based on the declining enrolment to most of the school boards to 1.5.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : It would have been great to have that information yesterday, however, the minister now does know it. Cape Breton-Victoria, Chignecto-Central, South Shore Regional, Strait Regional and Tri-County will all see direct funding cuts courtesy of this minister. So my question to the minister is this, with increasing operating costs and increasing program delivery costs, how are these five boards that are receiving less money expected to pay the bills without affecting students in our classroom?</p>

          <p>MS. JENNEX : We are investing in our students across the province. We have increased the funding per student by three per cent this year. We have a problem in our province that we are dealing with that is a nationwide problem with declining enrolment and we are doing that by investing properly and appropriately in our children in this province.</p>

          <p>MS. CASEY : I'm not sure how comforting those words will be to the parents and students in Tri-County or in South Shore. Both of those boards, Mr. Speaker - courtesy of this minister - have had funding cuts for the last three consecutive years. At the same time, courtesy of her NDP Government, power rates have been allowed to increase by 30 per cent. In 2012, for example, the power bill for Tri-County was over $1 million, the power bill for South Shore was over $1 million, and both of those are increases yet funding to those boards have been cut.</p>

To my point, the challenge for those members is that they can't stand it when someone does the right thing. They can't stand it when someone actually stands up and tells the truth, that's the unfortunate aspect of that group. They had an opportunity to govern and they've squandered it and instead of running on their own record they are now beginning to make up stuff, that Nova Scotians have stopped buying quite frankly.

          <p>MR. MCNEIL : Madam Speaker, it is a real concern. It's one more indication of what potentially will erode rural Nova Scotia. We need to be very mindful of the unintended consequences of the decision. Government has bought the land, it's there. Now what is going to happen with it? And let's not engage the citizens in a charade, let's be open and listen to what ideas they may have. It is a real concern to private woodlot owners in southwestern Nova Scotia and, I would dare say, across the province, that this land does not become low stumpage which depresses the private-sector market, because I'll tell you there are many families, there are many mixed-use farms, quite frankly, that rely on that income, require that income to feed their families and keep them afloat.</p>
