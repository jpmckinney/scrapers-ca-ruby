I'm happy to inform the House that these are the gentlemen responsible for our beautiful 16-foot Christmas tree that was donated to Province House.

          <p>HON. STEPHEN MCNEIL : Mr. Speaker, I want to, first of all, associate myself with the remarks of the Premier, and extend my condolences to the Parsons family. I think all of us in this House have family and cannot begin to imagine what the Parsons family is going through. To try to imagine the experience that Rehtaeh had gone through over the last number of years is just unimaginable. It saddens me though, I must say, that in the Province of Nova Scotia, so rich in so many ways, that young people like Rehtaeh feel no support and no hope, with all that we have to offer as a society that our children get to the point where there is no one left to turn to but the tragic consequences that Rehtaeh resorted to.</p>

          <p>HON. DIANA WHALEN : Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the Leader of the Official Opposition. I don't have the exact timing of that process that is underway with the DHAs and I think it would be more appropriate to let the Minister of Health and Wellness speak to that. I would like to suggest that we are looking for savings as we go forward and, as Finance Minister, in that capacity I'm looking for savings in all departments. We've asked for a 1 per cent reduction.</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : We've got two more questions so I just want to say first and foremost, where this is a significant change as to how we will deliver health care in the future, it is one that needs strong consultation with medical stakeholders, with the public, with unions. That will be kicked off and a schedule coming out early in the new year, when we will visit all of the existing nine DHAs. The overarching plan is in place but we now need to put the details for Nova Scotians early in the new year.</p>

I do know that we veered - all of us, from all sides - from that intent, from time to time, even just in the last two weeks, but I do want to return to that important place where we worked together on areas where we agree and this is one.</p>

I can say that we will not have that ready to provide for you when the update is done. I'm legislated to provide an update before the end of this calendar year, so that is underway.

I, like most Nova Scotians, was disappointed to read the details of past land dealings by the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie in today's ChronicleHerald. This October, when similar details were disclosed by the same publication, the Premier defended the member for Guysborough-Eastern Shore-Tracadie, alleging the story contained "misrepresented, distorted facts that aren't checked, that are inaccurate being put on, being out into the media as if they're accurate."

Five boards were told they would see funding cuts of nearly $5 million in total.

In fact, we are adding in more teachers as a result of increased funding where they are needed. We have instituted caps on class size and hired more teachers in order to make sure that that has happened. In addition to that, we are building new schools in communities throughout the province.

This government has tried to balance the books on the backs of our children. There are 700 teaching positions that have been eliminated since this government has taken power. Then, when school boards go about doing what is their responsibility when it comes to looking at their infrastructure, when they look at whether or not to close schools, when they go through the gut-wrenching experience of asking parents, teachers, and community members to come forward to make a concrete decision about what they can do, this minister interferes in that decision. But not only does the minister interfere - she interferes, but says, no new money.</p>

He has served the people of his municipality with distinction not only as a councillor but also as a warden, and they have rewarded that most recently by electing him to this Chamber.

Capital Health has reported that they expect to lose approximately $1.4 million on subsidies to private, fast-food providers like Tim Hortons on their premises each year and tried three times, under the previous NDP Government, to get permission to stop handing that money off to private companies like Tim Hortons, so that they could then spend it on actual health care delivery.</p>

It's one of those areas that when you come into government, it is part of the business plan for this year. So far it is underway. We are currently working with Capital Health to see whether or not the contract is there for a period of time and how we can now deal with this. It is a question that has come back to be a current one, not just from the Opposition bringing it forward but as we look at business plans and where future changes can be made that will, in fact, put that kind of money on the front line.</p>

Again this is an area where Nova Scotians have sent us here in government, in Opposition, to find areas of common ground that we can work on to make life better for them. Stopping the use of our tax dollars to subsidize a private Tim Hortons or other fast-food outlets in our hospitals is a great way to actually ensure that our tax dollars get to real health care delivery and send a message about the importance of health promotion in our hospitals themselves, where the government is not actually encouraging the sale of donuts and French fries and so on in their own cafeterias.</p>

A growing number of hard-working Nova Scotians are facing retirement without adequate pension income through workplace plans, personal savings and have only the Canada Pension Plan to rely on.

I would like to say that our government takes it very seriously that people are retiring without adequate replacement income from private pension plans or from their own savings or from the Canada Pension Plan. The member is wrong in saying that this would be - I wrote it down - she said in the very near future that this would help. An enhancement to the CPP will be a long-term position. It is not going to help in the near future. It won't help people who are already retired or about to retire. It will help young workers who are putting their money in for 30 or 40 years and then will retire.</p>

          <p>HON. JOHN MACDONELL : Mr. Speaker, I think when the member asked a question on this topic a couple of weeks back, I indicated that my staff were intending and trying to set up a meeting with stakeholders in the area, which included the representatives from the municipalities involved. That meeting happened yesterday and I haven't yet been briefed as to the outcome of that.</p>

          <p>MR. MACLELLAN : Mr. Speaker, basically how this works is the Transportation Association of Canada creates a set of standards that are abided by all provinces and all municipal units. We take those recommendations. The idea is to standardize them, so whether you're in Nova Scotia, you're in B.C., you're in all points in between, there's a standardized set of rules, signage and those type of things. That is the information that we have.</p>

          <p>MR. SAMSON : Mr. Speaker, I can't encourage the minister enough to look at this as an emergency situation. You've got people missing important medical appointments because of this loss of service. You have students who attend the Regional Occupational Centre in Port Hawkesbury who are being disrupted as well. People came to rely on this service, and I know the government has indicated how it sees this as an important service. I would hope that the minister would see this as an emergency situation and be prepared to put the funding necessary in place while a long-term solution is being carried out, because as we talk about this, we have riders who do not have a means of transportation, and that needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p>MR. MACDONELL : That was the game plan that my staff went down there with. It was the idea that we would use our envelope of funding that we have to help them in the short term until a long-term solution could happen. I think the member is aware that the province gave $120,000 last Fall and another $5,000 a couple of weeks back, and we were not informed about the impending shutdown of service. We do not fund fixed-route transit, Mr. Speaker, and it's my expectation that we will not be funding this into the long term. Thank you.</p>

I know that as an entrepreneur and as an individual, and I'm sure that there are many members of the House who have seen in our days some debts that weren't paid - money owing to us. One of the problems we have with this case, this instance, is that monies were paid out by the provincial government to take care of that debt. And certainly, I agree with the member opposite, a nice facility, a great facility down there. We did fill our obligation when we were asked by SWSDA to look after that debt, and we did that by writing the cheque.</p>

What I'm asking for him to do is to sit down with the local councils, maybe with some local business people, and sit down with Garian Construction, to see if there is a solution that can be found. Many times we've heard that litigation is the only way to go on this, but the difficulty we had all along with Garian Construction, the school community centre, is the fact that it is a Crown-owned property. It is attached to a school, and therefore, a lien couldn't be put on, and it would be very difficult to litigate that way.</p>

If the government aid package is insufficient, the temptation will be there for some struggling farmers to do nothing and hope for the best crop possible next year.

Unfortunately, under the present laws and the regulations we have, I do not have the ability to order those fields plowed under. There are some other processes we are looking at to see if we can make that happen, and hopefully it will happen. As the member is probably well aware, if they leave the strawberry plants in the field, the yield would be so low on it that it doesn't make any difference anyway, whether they keep them or not. But they should be plowed under, and we're going to endeavour to do everything we can to make sure those are plowed under.</p>

We were given an extra 200 to increase, so that's not a permanent increase, which, again, is unfortunate to meeting any of the goals that are outlined in the Immigration Strategy. The government has cut the international graduate stream. They cut the agri-food pilot stream, and the non-dependent child stream has also been cut, all because, according to a 2012 ChronicleHerald story, the federal government was irked that these streams existed, and perhaps duplicated.

The Liberals have promised a 1 per cent cut to almost every single government department, including the Department of Seniors. This is a small department that financially supports extremely important programs for our senior population.

          <p>MR. EDDIE ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Health and Wellness. If we want to ensure more seniors are able to stay in their homes, then the government needs to make that possible for struggling seniors. A constituent of mine, Ada Greene, receives home care twice a day and her husband, Cecil, struggles to keep the maintenance of their home on a fixed income. He cannot afford to pay to have his driveway shovelled but if it's not cleared, home care will not come to provide the services his wife needs. My question to the minister is, does the minister agree that this defeats the purpose of allowing the family to stay in their own homes?</p>

I know it is through individual issues and concerns that we are able to give more support to the home care program. This year the budget had a significant increase in home care and it obviously has not expanded to look after those kinds of needs at the moment. I will certainly take the member's letter and concern of his constituent under my concern.</p>

          <p>MR. ORRELL : Mr. Speaker, our seniors have worked hard and contributed all their lives. They deserve better than this. Mr. Greene struggles to keep his family's head above water. Once a month he's forced to visit the local food bank to ensure there is food on the table for him and his wife. The reality is this is not a situation unique to my constituency; seniors all over the province are struggling. Many who wish to remain in their homes find it unaffordable and the system is unresponsive. My question to the minister is, what choice is the minister giving the seniors? Does he really expect to keep seniors in their homes when they are already struggling to afford it?</p>

          <p>MR. GLAVINE : Mr. Speaker, it is an important question because we do have to keep more seniors in their homes and it is an expanded program that looks after what may seem to us as small needs that in fact are very significant and large needs when it comes to getting in the wood, cutting the lawn and, as the member opposite has brought up today, shovelling the snow to allow the caregivers to get to the house of a senior. It's one that I will take very seriously. At the moment we're reviewing the Continuing Care Program and all that that entails - and it does have a major emphasis and component around keeping seniors in their home.</p>

I know we want to expand the program. At the present time we're living with a budget that's already in place and one that is very difficult to make adaptations to at this point in the year, but I will certainly take this case and what it means in the larger picture of providing a full array of services to help seniors stay in their home.</p>

YOUNGER : Mr. Speaker, it's a little bit of a strange question because there are no specific assurances that I would provide, because I just finished telling the member that I will not stand for anything which reduces the service to Nova Scotians and, moreover, I'm not convinced and I'm not sure how Nova Scotia Power feels that they would deliver many of those services without actually having people living here - it's pretty hard to operate a plant if the people who are operating the plant don't live here, for example.</p>

          <p>MR. MACMASTER : Well, Mr. Speaker, word on the street is that a B.C. company called Valard Power is interested in picking up this contract. Now Nova Scotia Power's actions may be retaliation to the government's commitment to charge the efficiency tax to Nova Scotia Power. If labour costs form a smaller percentage of overall power rate costs and these changes will not lead to lower power bills, what is the government doing to address this matter for those workers who are living with uncertainty as we head into the Christmas season?</p>

          <p>HON. LEO GLAVINE : I thank the former Health and Wellness Minister for the question. CECs are proving to be valuable primary care extensions in our communities. There are very few that are providing urgent or emergency care. They are an important part of supplementing communities, especially ones that have shortages of physicians or nurse practitioners and our commitment, while a review will be going on, is to continue to support CECs.</p>

          <p>MR. DAVID WILSON : I think for us in our Party, and on this side, and I think Nova Scotians are cautious when they hear "review." We've heard many from the current government within health care and education that reviews will take place, and really reviews, Mr. Speaker, means a delay and that's why I find it extremely important that the Minister of Health and Wellness recognize the contributions of the change of model of care with Collaborative Emergency Centres. We have communities like Parrsboro, Springhill, Tatamagouche, Pugwash, Annapolis Royal, who currently now have available to their residents same-day or next-day appointments, which is extremely important.</p>
